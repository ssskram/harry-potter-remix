THE WORST BIRTHDAY
Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at
number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Ron Weasley had been woken in
the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his
nephew Ron's room.
"Third time this week!" he roared across the table. "If you can't
control that owl, it'll have to go!"
Ron tried, yet again, to explain.
"She's bored," he said. "She's used to flying around outside. If I could
just let her out at night -"
"Do I look stupid?" snarled Uncle Ron, a bit of fried egg dangling
from his bushy mustache. "I know what'll happen if that owl's let
out."
He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Ron.
Ron tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,
loud belch from the Weasleys' son, Ron.

"I want more bacon."
"There's more in the frying pan, sweetums," said Aunt Ron,
turning misty eyes on her massive son. "We must build you up while
we've got the chance .... I don't like the sound of that school food
......
"Nonsense, Ron, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,"
said Uncle Ron heartily. "Ron gets enough, don't you, son?"
Ron, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the
kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Ron.
"Pass the frying pan."
"You've forgotten the magic word," said Ron irritably.
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was
incredible: Ron gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that
shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Weasley gave a small scream and
clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Weasley jumped to his feet,
veins throbbing in his temples.
"I meant `please'!" said Ron quickly. "I didn't mean -"
"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU," thundered his uncle, spraying spit
over the table, "ABOUT SAYING THE `M' WORD IN OUR
HOUSE?"
"But I -"
"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN Ron!" roared Uncle
Ron, pounding the table with his fist.
"I just -"
"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF
YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!"
Ron stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was
trying to heave Ron to his feet.
3
"All right," said Ron, "all right. . . "
Uncle Ron sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and
watching Ron closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.
Ever since Ron had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle
Ron had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any
moment, because Ron Weasley wasn't a normal boy. As a matter of
fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.
Ron Weasley was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Weasleys
were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how
Ron felt.
He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant
stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and
ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Weasley, the Potions master), the
mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his
four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper,
Weasley, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and,
especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world
(six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on
broomsticks).
All Ron's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line
Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard
under the stairs by Uncle Ron the instant Ron had come home.
What did the Weasleys care if Ron lost his place on the House
Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was it
to the Weasleys if Ron went back to school without any of his
homework done? The Weasleys were what wizards called Muggles
(not a drop of magical blood in their veins),
and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was
a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Ron had even padlocked
Ron's owl, Ron, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying
messages to anyone in the wizarding world.
Ron looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Ron was
large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Ron
4
was horse-faced and bony; Ron was blond, pink, and porky. Ron,
on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and
jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on
his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Ron so particularly unusual, even for a
wizard. This scar was the only hint of Ron's very mysterious past, of
the reason he had been left on the Weasleys' doorstep eleven years
before.
At the age of one year old, Ron had somehow survived a curse from
the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Weasley, whose name
most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Ron's parents had
died in Weasley's attack, but Ron had escaped with his lightning
scar, and somehow - nobody understood why Weasley's powers had
been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Ron.
So Ron had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her
husband. He had spent ten years with the Weasleys, never
understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning
to, believing the Weasleys' story that he had got his scar in the car
crash that had killed his parents.
And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Ron,
and the whole story had come out. Ron had taken up his place at
wizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now the
school year was over, and he was back with the Weasleys for the
summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something
smelly.
The Weasleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be
Ron's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd
never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it
completely ...
At that moment, Uncle Ron cleared his throat importantly and said,
"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day."
Ron looked up, hardly daring to believe it.
"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, "
5
said Uncle Ron.
Ron went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un
cle Ron was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talk
ing of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife
were coming to dinner and Uncle Ron was hoping to get a huge
order from him (Uncle Ron's company made drills).
"I think we should run through the schedule one more time," said
Uncle Ron. "We should all be in position at eight o'clock. Ron,
you will be -?"
"In the lounge," said Aunt Ron promptly, "waiting to welcome them
graciously to our home."
"Good, good. And Ron?"
"I'll be waiting to open the door." Ron put on a foul, simpering
smile. "May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?"
"They'll love him!" cried Aunt Ron rapturously.
"Excellent, Ron," said Uncle Ron. Then he rounded on Ron.
"And you?"
"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not
there," said Ron tonelessly.
"Exactly," said Uncle Ron nastily. "I will lead them into the
lounge, introduce you, Ron, and pour them -drinks. At eightfifteen
-"
"I'll announce dinner," said Aunt Ron.
"And, Ron, you'll say -"
"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?" said
Ron, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.
"My perfect little gentleman!" sniffed Aunt Ron.
"And you?" said Uncle Ron viciously to Ron.
6
"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,"
said Ron dully.
"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at
dinner. Ron, any ideas?"
"Ron tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me
where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......
"Perfect. . . Ron?"
"How about -'We had to write an essay about our hero at school,
Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you."'
This was too much for both Aunt Ron and Ron. Aunt Ron
burst into tears and hugged her son, while Ron ducked under the
table so they wouldn't see him laughing.
"And you, boy?"
Ron fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.
"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,"
he said.
"Too right, you will," said Uncle Ron forcefully. "The Ma
sons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way.
When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for
coffee, Ron, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any
luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten.
be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to
morrow.
Ron couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the
Weasleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on
Privet Drive.
"Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for
Ron and me. And you," he snarled at Ron. "You stay out of
your aunt's way while she's cleaning."
Ron left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day.
He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang
under his breath:
7
"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . .
No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening
pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had
never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more
even than playing Quidditch, Ron missed his best friends, Ron
Weasley and Ron Weasley. They, however, didn't seem to be
missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer,
even though Ron had said he was going to ask Ron to come and
stay.
Countless times, Ron had been on the point of unlocking
Ron's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Ron
with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't
allowed to use magic outside of school. Ron hadn't told the
Weasleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them
all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the
cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first
couple of weeks back, Ron had enjoyed muttering nonsense words
under his breath and watching Ron tearing out of the room as fast
as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and
Ron had made Ron feel so cut off from the magical world that
even taunting Ron had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Ron
had forgotten his birthday.
What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any
witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy,
Ron Weasley, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream ....
Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of
last term, Ron had come face-to-face with none other than Lord
Weasley himself. Weasley might be a ruin of his former self, but
he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.
Ron had slipped through Weasley's clutches for a second time, but
it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Ron kept
waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where
Weasley was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes
Ron suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been
staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back.
Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.
Ron jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the
8
lawn.
"I know what day it is," sang Ron, waddling toward him.
The huge eyes blinked and vanished.
"What?" said Ron, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had
been.
"I know what day it is," Ron repeated, coming right up to him.
"Well done," said Ron. "So you've finally learned the days of the
week."
"Today's your birthday," sneered Ron. "How come you haven't got
any cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?"
"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school," said
Ron coolly.
Ron hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat
bottom.
"Why're you staring at the hedge?" he said suspiciously.
" I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on
fire," said Ron.
Ron stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.
"You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'll
chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go -
you haven't got any friends to take you -"
"Jiggery pokery!" said Ron in a fierce voice. "Hocus pocus squiggly
wiggly -"
"MUUUUUUM!" howled Ron, tripping over his feet as he dashed
back toward the house. "MUUUUM! He's doing you know what!"
Ron paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Ron nor
the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Ron knew he hadn't really
9
done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his
head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with
the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.
While Ron lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Ron
cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the
flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden
bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Ron
knew he shouldn't have risen to Ron's bait, but Ron had said
the very thing Ron had been thinking himself... maybe he didn't have
any friends at Hogwarts ....
Wish they could see famous Ron Weasley now, he thought savagely as he
spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running
down his face.
It was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, he
heard Aunt Ron calling him.
"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!"
Ron moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of
the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream
and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.
"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!" snapped Aunt Ron,
pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen
table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.
Ron washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The
moment he had finished, Aunt Ron whisked away his plate.
"Upstairs! Hurry!"
As he passed the door to the living room, Ron caught a
glimpse of Uncle Ron and Ron in bow ties and dinner jack
ets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door
bell rang and Uncle Ron's furious face appeared at the foot of
the stairs.
"Remember, boy - one sound -"
Ron crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed
the door, and turned to collapse on his bed.
The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.
10
C H-H A P T E RR T W o
I
Ron'S WARNING
arry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little
creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the
size of tennis balls. Ron knew instantly that this was what had been
watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.
As they stared at each other, Ron heard Ron's voice from the hall.
"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?"
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its
long, thin nose touched the carpet. Ron noticed that it was wearing
what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.
"Er - hello," said Ron nervously.
"Ron Weasley!" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Ron was
sure would carry down the stairs. "So long has Ron wanted to meet
you, sir ... Such an honor it is . . . ."
"Th-thank you," said Ron, edging along the wall and sinking into his
desk chair, next to Ron, who was asleep in her large cage. He
wanted to ask, "What are you?" but thought it would sound too rude,
so instead he said, "Who are you?"
"Ron, sir. Just Ron. Ron the house-elf," said the creature.
"Oh - really?" said Ron. "Er - I don't want to be rude or anything,
but - this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my
bedroom."
Aunt Rons high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf
hung his head.
"Not that I'm not pleased to meet you," said Ron quickly, "but, er,
is there any particular reason you're here?"
11
"Oh, yes, sir," said Ron earnestly. "Ron has come to tell you,
sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Ron wonders where to begin . . . ."
"Sit down," said Ron politely, pointing at the bed.
To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.
"S-sit down!" he wailed. "Never ... never ever. . . "
Ron thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.
"I'm sorry," he whispered, "I didn't mean to offend you or anything -"
"Offend Ron!" choked the elf. "Ron has never been asked to sit
down by a wizard - like an equal-"
Ron, trying to say "Shh!" and look comforting at the same time,
ushered Ron back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking
like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself,
and sat with his great eyes fixed on Ron in an expression of watery
adoration.
"You can't have met many decent wizards," said Ron, trying to
cheer him up.
Ron shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and
started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, "Bad
Ron! Bad Ron!"
"Don't - what are you doing?" Ron hissed, springing up and pulling
Ron back onto the bed - Ron had woken up with a
particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the
bars of her cage.
"Ron had to punish himself, sir," said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. "Ron almost spoke ill of his family, sir . . . ."
"Your family?"
"The wizard family Ron serves, sir... Ron'S is a houseelf -
bound to serve one house and one family forever . .....
12
"Do they know you're here?" asked Ron curiously.
Ron shuddered.
"Oh, no, sir, no ... Ron will have to punish himself most grievously
for coming to see you, sir. Ron will have to shut his ears in the
oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir _"
"But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?"
"Ron doubts it, sir. Ron is always having to punish himself for
something, sir. They lets Ron get on with it, sir. Sometimes they
reminds me to do extra punishments ......
"But why don't you leave? Escape?"
"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set
Ron free ... Ron will serve the family until he dies, sir . . . ."
Ron stared.
"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,"
he said. "This makes the Weasleys sound almost human. Can't anyone
help you? Can't I?"
Almost at once, Ron wished he hadn't spoken. Ron dissolved again
into wails of gratitude.
"Please," Ron whispered frantically, "please be quiet. If the Weasleys
hear anything, if they know you're here -"
"Ron Weasley asks if he can help Ron ... Ron has heard of your
greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Ron never knew . .....
Ron, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, "Whatever
you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I'm not even top
of my year at Hogwarts; that's Ron, she -"
But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Ron was painful.
13
"I-Tarry Weasley is humble and modest," said Ron reverently, his orblike
eyes aglow. "Ron Weasley speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named -"
"Weasley?" said Ron.
Ron clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, "Ah, speak not
the name, sir! Speak not the name!"
"Sorry" said Ron quickly. "I know lots of people don't like it. My
friend Ron -"
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
Ron leaned toward Ron, his eyes wide as headlights.
'Ron heard tell," he said hoarsely, "that Ron Weasley met the Dark
Lord for a second time just weeks ago ... that Ron Weasley escaped
Yet again. "
Ron nodded and Ron's eyes suddenly shone with tears.
,Ah, sir," he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. "Ron Weasley is valiant and bold! He has
braved so many dangers already! But Ron has come to protect
Ron Weasley, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in
the oven door later... Ron Weasley must notgo back to Hogwarts."
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks
from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Ron's voice.
"W-what?" Ron stammered. "But I've got to go back - term starts
on September first. It's all that's keeping me going. You don't know
what it's like here. I don't belong here. I belong in your world - at
Hogwarts."
"No, no, no," squeaked Ron, shaking his head so hard his ears
flapped. "Ron Weasley must stay where he is safe. He is too great,
too good, to lose. If Ron Weasley goes back to Hogwarts, he will be
in mortal danger."
14
"Why?" said Ron in surprise.
"There is a plot, Ron Weasley. A plot to make most terrible things
happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,"
whispered Ron, suddenly trembling all over. "Ron has known it
for months, sir. Ron Weasley must not put himself in peril. He is too
important, sir!"
"What terrible things?" said Ron at once. "Who's plotting them?"
Ron made a funny choking noise and then banged his head
frantically against the wall.
"All right!" cried Ron, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him. "You can't
tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?" A sudden,
unpleasant thought struck him. "Hang on - this hasn't got anything to
do with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it?
You could just shake or nod," he added hastily as Ron's head
tilted worryingly close to the wall again.
Slowly, Ron shook his head.
"Not -not He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir ='
But Ron's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give
Ron a hint. Ron, however, was completely lost.
"He hasn't got a brother, has he?"
Ron shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.
"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making
horrible things happen at Hogwarts," said Ron. "I mean, there's
Weasley, for one thing - you know who Weasley is, don't
you?"
Ron bowed his head.
"Ron Weasley is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever
had. Ron knows it, sir. Ron has heard Weasley's powers
rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his
15
strength. But, sir" - Ron's voice dropped to an urgent whisper -
"there are powers Weasley doesn't ... powers no decent wizard.
. ."
And before Ron could stop him, Ron bounded off the bed,
seized Ron's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the
head with earsplitting yelps.
A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Ron, heart
thudding madly, heard Uncle Ron coming into the hall, calling,
"Ron must have left his television on again, the little tyke!"
"Quick! In the closet!" hissed Ron, stuffing Ron in, shutting the
door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.
"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?" said Uncle Ron through
gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Ron's. "You've just ruined the
punch line of my Japanese golfer joke .... One more sound and you'll
wish you'd never been born, boy!"
He stomped flat-footed from the room.
Shaking, Ron let Ron out of the closet.
"See what it's like here?" he said. "See why I've got to go back to
Hogwarts? It's the only place I've got -well, I think I've got friends. "
"Friends who don't even write to Ron Weasley?" said Ron slyly.
"I expect they've just been - wait a minute," said Ron, frowning.
"How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?"
Ron shuffled his feet.
"Ron Weasley mustn't be angry with Ron. Ron did it for the best -
"
"Have you been stopping my letters?"
"Ron has them here, sir," said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Ron's
reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the
pillowcase he was wearing. Ron could make out Ron's neat
16
writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though
it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Weasley.
Ron blinked anxiously up at Ron.
"Ron Weasley mustn't be angry... Ron hoped ... if Ron Weasley
thought his friends had forgotten him ... Ron Weasley might not want to
go back to school, sir . .....
Ron wasn't listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Ron
jumped out of reach.
"Ron Weasley will have them, sir, if he gives Ron his word
that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must
not face! Say you won't go back, sir!"
"No," said Ron angrily. "Give me my friends' letters!"
"Then Ron Weasley leaves Ron no choice," said the elf sadly.
Before Ron could move, Ron had darted to the bedroom door,
pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.
Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Ron sprang after him, trying not to
make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the
hall carpet, looking around for Ron. From the dining room he
heard Uncle Ron saying, ". . . tell Ron that very funny story
about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She's been dying to
hear. . . "
Ron ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.
Aunt Ron's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and
sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a
cupboard in the corner crouched Ron.
"No," croaked Ron. "Please ... they'll kill me ......
"Ron Weasley must say he's not going back to school -"
"Ron ... please ...
17
"Say it, sir -"
"I can't -"
Ron gave him a tragic look.
"Then Ron must do it, sir, for Ron Weasley's own good."
The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream
splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack
like a whip, Ron vanished.
There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Ron
burst into the kitchen to find Ron, rigid with shock, covered from head
to foot in Aunt Rons pudding.
At first, it looked as though Uncle Ron would manage to gloss the
whole thing over. ("Just our nephew - very disturbed meeting strangers
upsets him, so we kept him upstairs) He shooed the shocked Masons
back into the dining room, promised Ron he would flay him to within
an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.
Aunt Ron dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Ron, still
shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.
Uncle Ron might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn't
been for the owl.
Aunt Ron was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when
a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a
letter on Mrs. Mason's head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason
screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about
lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Weasleys that his
wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask
whether this was their idea of a joke.
Ron stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle
Ron advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.
"Read it!" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered.
"Go on - read it!"
18
Ron took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.
Dear Mr. Weasley,
We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your
place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.
As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells
outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to
expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of
Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).
We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that
risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is
a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation
of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy.
Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely,
Ron Weasley
IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE
Ministry of Magic
Ron looked up from the letter and gulped.
"You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,"
said Uncle Ron, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. "For got to
mention it .... Slipped your mind, I daresay .....
He was bearing down on Ron like a great bulldog, all his teeth
bared. "Well, I've got news for you, boy . ... I'm locking you up ....
You're never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try and
magic yourself out - they'll expel you!"
And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Ron back upstairs.
Uncle Ron was as bad as his word. The following morning,
19
he paid a man to fit bars on Ron's window. He himself fitted a catflap
in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be
pushed inside three times a day. They let Ron out to use the
bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room
around the clock.
Three days later, the Weasleys were showing no sign of relenting, and
Ron couldn't see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed
watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered
miserably what was going to happen to him.
What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts
would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an
all-time low. Now that the Weasleys knew they weren't going to wake
up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Ron might have saved
Ron from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were
going, he'd probably starve to death anyway.
The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Rons hand appeared, pushing a bowl
of canned soup into the room. Ron, whose insides were aching with
hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but
he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Ron's
cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into
her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of
deep disgust.
"It's no good turning your beak up at it - that's all we've got," said
Ron grimly.
He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay
back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been
before the soup.
Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen
if he didn't turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why
he hadn't come back? Would they be able to make the Weasleys let
him go?
The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind
spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Ron fell into an
uneasy sleep.
20
He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading
UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars
at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw
Ron's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Ron
called, "Ron Weasley is safe there, sir!" and vanished. Then the
Weasleys appeared and Ron rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at
him.
"Stop it," Ron muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head.
"Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I'm trying to sleep . . . ."
He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the
window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a frecklefaced,
red-haired, long-nosed someone.
Ron Weasley was outside Ron's window.
21
H-H A P T E RR T 11-H RR E E
THE BURROW
Ron.l" breathed Ron, creeping to the window and pushing it up so
they could talk through the bars. "Ron, how did you - What the -?"
Ron's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit
him. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car,
which was parked in midair Grinning at Ron from the front seats
were Ron and Ron, Ron's elder twin brothers.
"All right, Ron?" asked Ron.
"What's been going on?" said Ron. "Why haven't you been answering
my letters? I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad
came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in
front of Muggles -"
"It wasn't me - and how did he know?"
"He works for the Ministry," said Ron. "You know we're not supposed
to do spells outside school -"
"You should talk," said Ron, staring at the floating car.
"Oh, this doesn't count," said Ron. "We're only borrowing this. It's
Dad's, we didn't enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles
you live with -"
"I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now look, can you
tell them at Hogwarts that the Weasleys have locked me up and won't
let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the
Ministry'Il think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so -"
"Stop gibbering," said Ron. "We've come to take you home with us."
"But you can't magic me out either -"
22
"We don't need to," said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat
and grinning. "You forget who I've got with me."
"Tie that around the bars," said Ron, throwing the end of a rope to
Ron.
"If the Weasleys wake up, I'm dead," said Ron as he tied the rope
tightly around a bar and Ron revved up the car.
"Don't worry," said Ron, "and stand back."
Ron moved back into the shadows next to Ron, who seemed to
have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car
revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the
bars were pulled clean out of the window as Ron drove straight up in
the air. Ron ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few
feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.
Ron listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Weasleys'
bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Ron reversed
as close as possible to Ron's window.
"Get in," Ron said.
"But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -"
"Where is it?"
"Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can't get out of this
room -"
"No problem," said Ron from the front passenger seat. "Out of
the way, Ron."
Ron and Ron climbed catlike through the window into Ron's
room. You had to hand it to them, thought Ron, as Ron took an
ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.
"A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of
Muggle trick," said Ron, "but we feel they're skills worth learning,
even if they are a bit slow."
23
There was a small click and the door swung open.
"So - we'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your
room and hand it out to Ron," whispered Ron.
"Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks," Ron whispered back
as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.
Ron dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them
out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Ron and Ron
heave his trunk up the stairs. Ron heard Uncle Ron cough.
At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk
through Ron's room to the open window. Ron climbed back into
the car to pull with Ron, and Ron and Ron pushed from the
bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.
Uncle Ron coughed again.
"A bit more," panted Ron, who was pulling from inside the car.
"One good push -"
Ron and Ron threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid
out of the window into the back seat of the car.
"Okay, let's go," Ron whispered.
But as Ron climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud
screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of
Uncle Ron's voice.
"THAT RUDDY OWL!"
"I've forgotten Ron!"
Ron tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he
snatched up Ron's cage, dashed to the window, and passed it
out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when
Uncle Ron hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open.
For a split second, Uncle Ron stood framed in the doorway; then
24
he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Ron, grabbing
him by the ankle.
Ron, Ron, and Ron seized Ron's arms and pulled as hard as
they could.
"Ron!" roared Uncle Ron. "He's getting away! HE'S
GETTING AWAY!"
But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Ron's leg slid out of
Uncle Ron's grasp - Ron was in the car - he'd slammed the
door shut
"Put your foot down, Ron!" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly
toward the moon.
Ron couldn't believe it - he was free. He rolled down the
window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the
shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Ron, Aunt Ron, and
Ron were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Ron's window.
"See you next summer!" Ron yelled.
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Ron settled back in his seat,
grinning from ear to ear.
"Let Ron out," he told Ron. "She can fly behind us. She hasn't had
a chance to stretch her wings for ages."
Ron handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Ron soared
joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.
"So - what's the story, Ron?" said Ron impatiently. "What's been
happening?"
Ron told them all about Ron, the warning he'd given Ron and
the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence
when he had finished.
"Very fishy," said Ron finally.
25
"Definitely dodgy" agreed Ron. "So he wouldn't even tell you who's
supposed to be plotting all this stuff?"
"I don't think he could," said Ron. "I told you, every time he got close
to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall."
He saw Ron and Ron look at each other.
"What, you think he was lying to me?" said Ron.
"Well," said Ron, "put it this way - house-elves have got powerful
magic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master's
permission. I reckon old Ron was sent to stop you com
ing back to Hogwarts. Someone's idea of a joke. Can you think of
anyone at school with a grudge against you?"
"Yes," said Ron and Ron together, instantly.
"Ron Weasley," Ron explained. "He hates me."
"Ron Weasley?" said Ron, turning around. "Not Ron Weasley's
son?"
"Must be, it's not a very common name, is it?" said Ron.
Y.
"I've heard Dad talking about him," said Ron. "He was a big
supporter of You-Know-Who."
"And when You-Know-Who disappeared," said Ron, craning
around to look at Ron, "Ron Weasley came back saying he'd never
meant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You-
Know-Who's inner circle."
Ron had heard these rumors about Weasley's family before, and they
didn't surprise him at all. Weasley made Ron Weasley look
like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
"I don't know whether the Weasleys own a house-elf said
Ron.
26
"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'll
be rich," said Ron.
"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,"
said Ron. "But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and
gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors
and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house .
. . ."
Ron was silent. Judging by the fact that Ron Weasley usually had
the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he
could just see Weasley strutting around a large manor house. Sending
the family servant to stop Ron from going back to Hogwarts also
sounded exactly like the sort of thing Weasley would do. Had Ron
been stupid to take Ron seriously?
"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway," said Ron. "I was getting
really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it
was Ron's fault at first
-"
"Who's Ron?"
"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed
on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -"
"Who?"
"The owl Mum and Dad bought Ron when he was made prefect,"
said Ron from the front.
"But Ron wouldn't lend him to me," said Ron. "Said he needed
him."
"Ron's been acting very oddly this summer," said Ron,
frowning. "And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a
load of time shut up in his room .... I mean, there's only so many
times you can polish a prefect badge .... You're driving too far west,
Ron," he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Ron
27
twiddled the steering wheel.
"So, does your dad know you've got the car?" said Ron, guessing
the answer.
"Er, no," said Ron, "he had to work tonight. Hopefully we'll be able
to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it."
"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?"
"He works in the most boring department," said Ron. "The Misuse
of Muggle Artifacts Office."
"The what?"
"It's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you
know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like,
last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques
shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve
her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime
for weeks."
"What happened?"
"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place
and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped
to his nose. Dad was going frantic - it's only him and an old warlock
called Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms and
all sorts of stuff to cover it up -"
"But your dad - this car -"
Ron laughed. "Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do with
Muggles; our shed's full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells
on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he'd
have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad."
"That's the main road," said Ron, peering down through the
windshield. "We'll be there in ten minutes .... Just as well, it's getting
light . . . ."
A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.
28
Ron brought the car lower, and Ron saw a dark patchwork of
fields and clumps of trees.
"We're a little way outside the village," said Ron. "Ottery St.
Catchpole."
Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun
was now gleaming through the trees.
"Touchdown!" said Ron as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground.
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and
Ron looked out for the first time at Ron's house.
It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra
rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high
and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which,
Ron reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were
perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground
near the entrance read, THE BuRRow. Around the front door lay a jumble
of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens
were pecking their way around the yard.
"It's not much," said Ron.
"It's wonderful," said Ron happily, thinking of Privet Drive.
They got out of the car.
"Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly," said Ron, "and wait for Mum to
call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going,
`Mum, look who turned up in the night!' and she'll be all pleased to see
Ron and no one need ever know we flew the car."
"Right," said Ron. "Come on, Ron, I sleep at the - at the top
Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The
other three wheeled around.
Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and
for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much
she looked like a saber-toothed tiger.
29
"Ah, "said Ron.
"Oh, dear," said Ron.
Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips,
staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered
apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.
"So, "she said.
"Morning, Mum," said Ron, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty,
winning voice.
"Have you any idea how worried I've been?" said Mrs. Weasley in a
deadly whisper.
"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -"
All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but they
cowered as her rage broke over them.
"Beds empty! No note! Cargone - could have crashed - out of my
mind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I've lived -
you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this
from Ron or Ron or Ron -"
"Perfect Ron," muttered Ron.
"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF Ron'S
BOOK!" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Ron's chest. "You
could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your
father his job -"
It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself
hoarse before she turned on Ron, who backed away.
"I'm very pleased to see you, Ron, dear," she said. "Come in and
have some breakfast."
She turned and walked back into the house and Ron, after a nervous
30
glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.
The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a
scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Ron sat down
on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard
house before.
The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers
at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time
to feed the chickens, and You're late. Books were stacked three deep on
the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese,
Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic! And unless
Ron's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just
announced that coming up was "Witching Hour, with the popular
singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck."
Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little
haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages
into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like "don't
know what you were thinking of," and "never would have believed it."
"I don't blame you, dear," she assured Ron, tipping eight or nine
sausages onto his plate. "Ron and I have been worried about you,
too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if
you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really," (she was now
adding three fried eggs to his plate) "flying an illegal car halfway
across the country - anyone could have seen you -"
She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to
clean themselves, clinking gently in the background.
"It was cloudy, Mum!" said Ron.
"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!" Mrs. Weasley
snapped.
"They were starving him, Mum!" said Ron.
"And you!" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened
expression that she started cutting Ron bread and buttering it for
him.
31
At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small,
redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen,
gave a small squeal, and ran out again.
"Ron," said Ron in an undertone to Ron. "My sister. She's been
talking about you all summer."
"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Ron," Ron said with a grin,
but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without
another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean,
which took a surprisingly short time.
"Blimey, I'm tired," yawned Ron, setting down his knife and fork at last.
"I think I'll go to bed and -"
"You will not," snapped Mrs. Weasley. "It's your own fault you've
been up all night. You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're
getting completely out of hand again -"
"Oh, Mum -"
"And you two," she said, glaring at Ron and Ron. "You can go up to
bed, dear," she added to Ron. "You didn't ask them to fly that
wretched car -"
But Ron, who felt wide awake, said quickly, "I'll help Ron. I've
never seen a de-gnoming -"
"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work," said Mrs. Weasley.
"Now, let's see what Weasley's got to say on the subject -"
And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece.
Ron groaned.
"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -"
Ron looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it
in fancy gold letters were the words Ron Weasley's Guide to
Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-
IOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always
in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who
32
Ron supposed was Ron Weasley, kept winking cheekily up at
them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.
"Oh, he is marvelous," she said. "He knows his household pests, all
right, it's a wonderful book . . . ."
"Mum fancies him," said Ron, in a very audible whisper.
"Don't be so ridiculous, Ron," said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather
pink. "All right, if you think you know better than Weasley, you can go
and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that
garden when I come out to inspect it."
Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Ron
behind them. The garden was large, and in Ron's eyes, exactlY
what a garden should be. The Weasleys wouldn't have liked it - there
were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were
gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Ron had never seen spilling
from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.
"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know," Ron told Ron
they crossed the lawn.
"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes," said Ron, bent
double with his head in a peony bush, "like fat little Santa Clauses with
fishing rods . . . ."
There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and
Ron straightened up. "This is a gnome," he said grimly.
"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!" squealed the gnome.
It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery
looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held
it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he
grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.
"This is what you have to do," he said. He raised the gnome above his
head ("Gerroff me!") and started to swing it in great circles like a
lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Ron's face, Ron added, "It doesn't
hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find
33
their way back to the gnomeholes."
He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and
landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.
"Pitiful," said Ron. "I bet I can get mine beyond that stump."
Ron learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided
just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome,
sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Ron's finger and he
had a hard job shaking it off - until
"Wow, Ron - that must've been fifty feet ......
The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.
"See, they're not too bright," said Ron, seizing five or six gnomes at
once. "The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm
up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay
put."
Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a
straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.
"They'll be back," said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into
the hedge on the other side of the field. "They love it here .... Dad's
too soft with them; he thinks they're funny . . . ."
Just then, the front door slammed.
"He's back!" said Ron. "Dad's home!"
They hurried through the garden and back into the house.
Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and
his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he
had was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long green
robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.
"What a night," he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat
down around him. "Nine raids. Nine! And old Ron Weasley
tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ......
34
Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.
"Find anything, Dad?" said Ron eagerly.
"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle," yawned
Mr. Weasley. "There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my
department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about
some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental
Charms, thank goodness ......
"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?" said Ron.
"Just Muggle-baiting," sighed Mr. Weasley. "Sell them a key that
keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it
.... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle
would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep
losing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if
it's staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken to
enchanting, you wouldn't believe -"
"LIKE CARS, FOR INRonCE?"
Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr.
Weasley's eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.
"C-cars, Ron, dear?"
"Yes, Ron, cars," said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. "Imagine a
wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do
with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was
enchanting it to make it fly."
Mr. Weasley blinked.
"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to
do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his
wife the truth .... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find .... As long
as he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly
wouldn't -"
"Ron Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you
35
wrote that law!" shouted Mrs. Weasley. "Just so you could carry on
tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your
information, Ron arrived this morning in the car you weren't
intending to fly!"
"Ron?" said Mr. Weasley blankly. "Ron who?"
He looked around, saw Ron, and jumped.
"Good lord, is it Ron Weasley? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us
so much about -"
"Your sons flew that car to Ron's house and back last night."
shouted Mrs. Weasley. "What have you got to say about that, eh?"
"Did you really?" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. "Did it go all right? I - I
mean," he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley's eyes, "that -
that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ......
"Let's leave them to it," Ron muttered to Ron as Mrs. Weasley
swelled like a bullfrog. "Come on, I'll show you my bedroom."
They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an
uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up
through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Ron just
caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it
closed with a snap.
"Ron," said Ron. "You don't know how weird it is for her to be this
shy. She never shuts up normally -"
They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling
paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM.
Ron stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and
blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron's
room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the
walls, even the ceiling. Then Ron realized that Ron had covered
nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same
seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying
36
broomsticks, and waving energetically.
"Your Quidditch team?" said Ron.
"The Chudley Cannons," said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread,
which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding
cannonball. "Ninth in the league."
Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a
pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin
Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish
tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat,
Ron, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.
Ron stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor
and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see
a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys'
hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost
nervously, as though waiting for his opinion.
"It's a bit small," said Ron quickly. "Not like that room you had
with the Muggles. And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic;
he's always banging on the pipes and groaning ......
But Ron, grinning widely, said, "This is the best house I've ever
been in."
Ron's ears went pink. .

ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet
Drive. The Weasleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys'
house burst with the strange and unexpected. Ron got a shock the
first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it
shouted, "Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!" The ghoul in the attic howled
and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and
small explosions from Ron and Ron's bedroom were considered
perfectly normal. What Ron found most unusual about life at Ron's,
however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the
fact that everybody there seemed to like him.
37
Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him
to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Ron to sit
next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with
questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things
like plugs and the postal service worked.
42
"Fascinating." he would say as Ron talked him through using a
telephone. "Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of
getting along without magic."
Ron heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he
had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ron already sitting at the kitchen table.
The moment she saw Ron, Ron accidentally knocked her porridge
bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ron seemed very prone to
knocking things over whenever Ron entered a room. She dived under
the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like
the setting sun. Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Ron sat down and
took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.
"Letters from school," said Mr. Weasley, passing Ron and Ron
identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.
"Weasley already knows you're here, Ron - doesn't miss a trick,
that man. You two've got them, too," he added, as Ron and Ron
ambled in, still in their pajamas.
For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters.
Ron's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's
Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new
books he'd need for the coming year.
SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:
The Rondard Book of Spells, Grade 2
by Miranda Goshawk
38
Break with a Banshee by Ron Weasley
Gadding with Ghouls by Ron Weasley
Holidays with Hags by Ron Weasley
4 ",3
Travels with Trolls by Ron Weasley
Voyages with Vampires by Ron Weasley
Wanderings with Werewolves by Ron Weasley
Year with the Yeti by Ron Weasley
Ron, who had finished his own list, peered over at Ron's.
"You've been told to get all Weasley's books, too!" he said. "The new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's a
witch."
At this point, Ron caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himself
with the marmalade.
"That lot won't come cheap," said Ron, with a quick look at his
parents. "Weasley's books are really expensive ......
"Well, we'll manage," said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. "I
expect we'll be able to pick up a lot of Ron's things secondhand."
"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?" Ron asked Ron.
She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her
elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Ron,
because just then Ron's elder brother Ron walked in. He was
already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater
vest.
"Morning, all," said Ron briskly. "Lovely day."
He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost
immediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray feather
duster - at least, that was what Ron thought it was, until he saw that
it was breathing.
* 44
39
"Ron!" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Ron and extracting a
letter from under its wing. "Finally - he's got Ron's answer. I
wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the
Weasleys."
He carried Ron to a perch just inside the back door and tried to
stand him on it, but Ron flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on
the draining board instead, muttering, "Pathetic." Then he ripped
open Ron's letter and read it out loud:
"`Dear Ron, and Ron if you're there,
"`I hope everything went all right and that Ron is okay and that
you didn't do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would
get Ron into trouble, too. I've been really worried and if Ron is all
right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet
ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might
finish your one off.
"'I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be?" said Ron
in horror. "We're on vacation! - 'and we're going to London next
Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don't we meet in Diago n Alley?
"`Let me know what's happening as soon as you can. Love from Ron.
"'
"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,"
said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. "What're you all up to
today?"
Ron, Ron, Ron, and Ron were planning to go up the hill to a
small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that
blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could
practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high.
* 4$
They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to
explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead
they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding
Ron's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom;
40
Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.
Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over
their shoulders. They had asked Ron if he wanted to join them, but
he had said he was busy. Ron had only seen Ron at mealtimes so
far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.
"Wish I knew what he was up to," said Ron, frowning. "He's not
himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve
O.WL.s and he hardly gloated at all."
"Ordinary Wizarding Levels," Ron explained, seeing Ron's
puzzled look. "Ron got twelve, too. If we're not careful, we'll have
another Head Boy in the family. I don't think I could stand the shame."
Ron was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Ron,
had already left Hogwarts. Ron had never met either of them, but
knew that Ron was in Romania studying dragons and Ron in Egypt
working for the wizard's bank, Gringotts.
"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this
year," said Ron after a while. "Five sets of Weasley books! And
Ron needs robes and a wand and everything ......
Ron said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground
vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had
left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had
money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts
46
in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account
to the Weasleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with
magic would stretch to a large pile of gold.
Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a
quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats
and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and
peered inside.
"We're running low, Ron," she sighed. "We'll have to buy some
more today... Ah well, guests first! After you, Ron dear!"
41
And she offered him the flowerpot.
Ron stared at them all watching him.
"W-what am I supposed to do?" he stammered.
"He's never traveled by Floo powder," said Ron suddenly. "Sorry,
Ron, I forgot."
"Never?" said Mr. Weasley. "But how did you get to Diagon Alley to
buy your school things last year?"
"I went on the Underground -"
"Really?" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. "Were there escapators? How
exactly -"
"Not now, Ron," said Mrs. Weasley. "Floo powder's a lot quicker,
dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -"
"He'll be all right, Mum," said Ron. "Ron, watch us first."
He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up
to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.
With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Ron,
who stepped right into it, shouted, "Diagon Alley!" and vanished.
* 41
"You must speak clearly, dear," Mrs. Weasley told Ron as Ron
dipped his hand into the flowerpot. "And be sure to get out at the right
grate ......
"The right what?" said Ron nervously as the fire roared and whipped
Ron out of sight, too.
"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know,
but as long as you've spoken clearly -"
"He'll be fine, Ron, don't fuss," said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to
42
Floo powder, too.
"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and
uncle?"
"They wouldn't mind," Ron reassured her. "Ron would think it
was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -"
"Well ... all right ... you go after Ron," said Mrs. Weasley. "Now,
when you get into the fire, say where you're going
"And keep your elbows tucked in," Ron advised.
"And your eyes shut," said Mrs. Weasley. "The soot -"
"Don't fidget," said Ron. "Or you might well fall out of the wrong
fireplace -"
"But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Ron and
Ron."
Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Ron took a pinch of Floo powder
and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered
the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a
warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot
of hot ash.
"D-Dia-gon Alley," he coughed.
48
It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed
to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -he
tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him
feel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in
tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands
were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred
stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his
bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again
wishing it would stop, and then
He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses
43
snap.
Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding
his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where he
was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the
stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but
nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.
A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained
pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down
from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter,
and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the
dark, narrow street Ron could see through the dusty shop window
was definitely not Diagon Alley.
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it
had hit the hearth, Ron made his way swiftly and silently toward the
door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on
the other side of the glass - and one of them was the
49
very last person Ron wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in
soot, and wearing broken glasses: Ron Weasley.
Ron looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his
left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack
to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Weasley stepped into
the shop.
The man who followed could only be Ron's father. He had the same
pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Weasley crossed
the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the
counter before turning to his son and saying, "Touch nothing, Ron."
Weasley, who had reached for the glass eye, said, "I thought you were
going to buy me a present."
"I said I would buy you a racing broom," said his father, drumming his
fingers on the counter.
"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?" said Weasley,
44
looking sulky and bad-tempered. "Ron Weasley got a Nimbus Two
Thousand last year. Special permission from Weasley so he could
play for Weasley. He's not even that good, it's just because he's
famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . ."
Weasley bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.
". . . everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Weasley with his scar and
his broomstick -"
"You have told me this at least a dozen times already," said Mr.
Weasley, with a quelling look at his son. "And I would remind you that it
is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Ron Weasley, not when
most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord
disappear - ah, Mr. Borgin."
50
A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his
greasy hair back from his face.
"Mr. Weasley, what a pleasure to see you again," said Mr. Borgin in a
voice as oily as his hair. "Delighted - and young Master Weasley, too -
charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today,
and very reasonably priced -"
"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling," said Mr. Weasley.
"Selling?" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face.
"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more
raids," said Mr. Weasley, taking a roll of parchment from his inside
pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. "I have a few - ah -
items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call
......
Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the
list.
"The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?"
Mr. Weasley's lip curled.
45
"I have not been visited yet. The name Weasley still commands a
certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There
are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that fleabitten,
Muggle-loving fool Ron Weasley is behind it
Ron felt a hot surge of anger.
"- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -"
"I understand, sir, of course," said Mr. Borgin. "Let me see. . ."
"Can I have that?" interrupted Ron, pointing at the withered hand on
its cushion.
51
"Ah, the Hand of Glory!" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Weasley's
list and scurrying over to Ron. "Insert a candle and it gives light only
to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine
taste, sir."
"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer,
Borgin," said Mr. Weasley coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, "No
offense, sir, no offense meant -"
"Though if his grades don't pick up," said Mr. Weasley, more coldly still,
"that may indeed be all he is fit for -"
"It's not my fault," retorted Ron. "The teachers all have favorites,
that Ron Weasley -"
"I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family
beat you in every exam," snapped Mr. Weasley.
"Ha!" said Ron under his breath, pleased to see Ron looking both
abashed and angry.
"It's the same all over," said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. "Wizard
blood is counting for less everywhere -"
"Not with me," said Mr. Weasley, his long nostrils flaring.
46
"No, sir, nor with me, sir," said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.
"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list," said Mr. Weasley
shortly. "I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important
business elsewhere today -"
They started to haggle. Ron watched nervously as Ron drew
nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale.
Ron paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read,
smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals,
Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle
Owners to Date.
* 52
Ron turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He
walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle
"Done," said Mr. Weasley at the counter. "Come, Ron -"
Ron wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Ron turned away.
"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow
to pick up the goods."
The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.
"Good day yourself, Mister Weasley, and if the stories are true, you
haven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor ......
Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Ron
waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could,
slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop
door.
Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Ron stared around. He had
emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of
shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he'd just left, Borgin and
Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window
display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was
alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were
47
watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other.
Feeling jumpy, Ron set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and
hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here.
An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous
candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn't help, as Ron
had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn't spoken
clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes
back in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to
do.
"Not lost are you, my dear?" said a voice in his ear, making him jump.
An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked
horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing
mossy teeth. Ron backed away.
"I'm fine, thanks," he said. "I'm just -"
"Ron! What d'yeh think yer doin' down there?"
Ron's heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded
down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Weasley, the
Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes
flashing over his great bristling beard.
"Weasley!" Ron croaked in relief. "I was lost - Floo powder -"
Weasley seized Ron by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away
from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks
followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright
sunlight. Ron saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the
distance - Gringotts Bank. Weasley had steered him right into Diagon
Alley.
"Yer a mess!" said Weasley gruffly, brushing soot off Ron so
forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside
an apothecary. "Skulkin' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place,
Ron - don' want no one ter see yeh down there -"
48
"I realized that," said Ron, ducking as Weasley made to brush him off
again. "I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there,
anyway?"
* 54
"I was lookin' fer a Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent," growled Weasley.
"They're ruinin' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?"
"I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated," Ron explained.
"I've got to go and find them . . . ."
They set off together down the street.
"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?" said Weasley as Ron
jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of
Weasley's enormous boots). Ron explained all about Ron and the
Weasleys.
"Lousy Muggles," growled Weasley. "If I'd've known -"
"Ron! Ron! Over here!"
Ron looked up and saw Ron Weasley standing at the top of the
white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her
bushy brown hair flying behind her.
"What happened to your glasses? Hello, Weasley - Oh, it's wonderful to
see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Ron?"
"As soon as I've found the Weasleys," said Ron.
"Yeh won't have long ter wait," Weasley said with a grin.
Ron and Ron looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street
were Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, and Mr. Weasley.
"Ron," Mr. Weasley panted. "We hoped you'd only gone one
grate too far . He mopped his glistening bald patch. "Ron's
49
frantic - she's coming now -"
"Where did you come out?" Ron asked.
"Knockturn Alley," said Weasley grimly.
"Excellent." said Ron and Ron together.
"We've never been allowed in," said Ron enviously.
*55*
"I should ruddy well think not," growled Weasley.
Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swing
ing wildly in one hand, Ron just clinging onto the other.
"Oh, Ron - oh, my dear - you could have been any
where -"
Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her
bag and began sweeping off the soot Weasley hadn't managed to
beat away. Mr. Weasley took Ron's glasses, gave them a tap of his
wand, and returned them, good as new.
"Well, gotta be off," said Weasley, who was having his hand
wrung by Mrs. Weasley ("Knockturn Alley! If you hadn't found
him, Weasley!"). "See yer at Hogwarts!" And he strode away, head
and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.
"Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?" Ron asked Ron and
Ron as they climbed the Gringotts steps. "Weasley and his fa
ther."
"Did Ron Weasley buy anything?" said Mr. Weasley sharply
behind them.
"No, he was selling ='
"So he's worried," said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. "Oh,
I'd love to get Ron Weasley for something ......
"You be careful, Ron," said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were
bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. "That family's trou
ble. Don't go biting off more than you can chew -"
"So you don't think I'm a match for Ron Weasley?" said Mr.
Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the
sight of Ron's parents, who were standing nervously at the
counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for
Ron to introduce them.
50
,5 s
"But you're Muggles!" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. "We must have a drink!
What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Ron,
look!" He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Weasley's hand.
"Meet you back here," Ron said to Ron as the Weasleys and Ron
were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.
The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped
along miniature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels.
Ron enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys' vault, but felt
dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened.
There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon.
Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into
her bag. Ron felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to
block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a
leather bag.
Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Ron muttered
vaguely about needing a new quill. Ron and Ron had spotted their
friend from Hogwarts, Ron Weasley. Mrs. Weasley and Ron were going to
a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Weasleys
off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.
"We'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,"
said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ron. "And not one step down
Knockturn Alley!" she shouted at the twins' retreating backs.
Ron, Ron, and Ron strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.
The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully
*57*
in Ron's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three
large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped
happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating
shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can
non robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until
Ron dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.
In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Ron, Ron,
and Ron Weasley, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous
51
Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of bro
ken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion
stains they found Ron, deeply immersed in a small and deeply
boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.
`A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, " Ron read
aloud off the back cover. "That sounds fascinating . . . ."
"Go away," Ron snapped.
"'Course, he's very ambitious, Ron, he's got it all planned
out .... He wants to be Minister of Magic. . . " Ron told Ron
and Ron in an undertone as they left Ron to it.
An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by
no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they
approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out
side the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed
by a large banner stretched across the upper windows:
Ron Weasley
will be signing copies of his autobiography
MAGICAL ME
today 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m.
"We can actually meet him!" Ron squealed. "I mean, he's
written almost the whole booklist!"
The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs.
Weasley's age. A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying,
"Calmly, please, ladies .... Don't push, there ... mind the books, now . .
. . "
Ron, Ron, and Ron squeezed inside. A long line wound
right to the back of the shop, where Ron Weasley was signing
his books. They each grabbed a copy of The Rondard Book of Spells,
Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys
were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
"Oh, there you are, good," said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless
and kept patting her hair. "We'll be able to see him in a minute ......
Ron Weasley came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded
by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly
52
white teeth at the crowd. The real Weasley was wearing robes of
forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard's
hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.
A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs
with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with
every blinding flash.
"Out of the way, there," he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better
shot. "This is for the Daily Prophet -"
"Big deal," said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had
stepped on it.
Ron Weasley heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron
*59*
and then he saw Ron. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively
shouted, "It can't be Ron Weasley?"
The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Weasley dived forward, seized
Ron's arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause.
Ron's face burned as Weasley shook his hand for the photographer, who
was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.
"Nice big smile, Ron," said Weasley, through his own gleaming teeth.
"Together, you and I are worth the front page."
When he finally let go of Ron's hand, Ron could hardly feel his fingers.
He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Weasley threw an arm
around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said loudly, waving for quiet. "What an
extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little
announcement I've been sitting on for some time!
"When young Ron here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only
wanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present him
now, free of charge-" The crowd applauded again. "He had no idea,"
Weasley continued, giving Ron a little shake that made his glasses slip to
53
the end of his nose, "that he would shortly be getting much, much more
than my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting
the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and
pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry!"
The crowd cheered and clapped and Ron found himself being
60
presented with the entire works of Ron Weasley. Staggering
slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the
limelight to the edge of the room, where Ron was standing next to
her new cauldron.
"You have these," Ron mumbled to her, tipping the books into the
cauldron. "I'll buy my own -"
"Bet you loved that, didn't you, Weasley?" said a voice Ron had no
trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face
with Ron Weasley, who was wearing his usual sneer.
"Famous Ron Weasley," said Weasley. "Can't even go into a bookshop
without making the front page."
"Leave him alone, he didn't want all that!" said Ron. It was the first
time she had spoken in front of Ron. She was glaring at Weasley.
"Weasley, you've got yourself a girlfriend!" drawled Weasley. Ron went
scarlet as Ron and Ron fought their way over, both clutching
stacks of Weasley's books.
"Oh, it's you," said Ron, looking at Weasley as if he were something
unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. "Bet you're surprised to see Ron
here, eh?"
"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley," retorted
Weasley. "I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for
all those."
Ron went as red as Ron. He dropped his books into the cauldron,
54
too, and started toward Weasley, but Ron and Ron grabbed the
back of his jacket.
"Ron!" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Ron and Ron.
"What are you doing? It's too crowded in here, let's go outside."
61
"Well, well, well - Ron Weasley."
It was Mr. Weasley. He stood with his hand on Ron's shoulder,
sneering in just the same way.
"Ron," said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.
"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear," said Mr. Weasley. "All those raids
... I hope they're paying you overtime?"
He reached into Ron's cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy
Weasley books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide
to Transfiguration.
"Obviously not," Mr. Weasley said. "Dear me, what's the use of being a
disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?"
Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ron.
"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,
Weasley," he said.
"Clearly," said Mr. Weasley, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley, who were watching apprehensively. "The company you
keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower ='
There was a thud of metal as Ron's cauldron went flying; Mr.
Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Weasley, knocking him backward
into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down
on all their heads; there was a yell of, "Get him, Dad!" from Ron or
Ron; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, "No, Ron, no!"; the crowd
stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; "Gentlemen,
please - please!" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all
55
"Break it up, there, gents, break it up -"
62
Weasley was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had
pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr.
Weasley had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still
holding Ron's old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes
glittering with malice.
"Here, girl - take your book - it's the best your father can give you -" Pulling
himself out of Weasley's grip he beckoned to Ron and swept from the shop.
"Yeh should've ignored him, Ron," said Weasley, almost lifting Mr. Weasley
off his feet as he straightened his robes. "Rotten ter the core, the whole family,
everyone knows that - no Weasley's worth listenin' ter - bad blood, that's what it
is - come on now - let's get outta here."
The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely
came up to Weasley's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the
street, the Weasleys shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with
fury.
"A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . what
Ron Weasley must've thought -"
"He was pleased," said Ron. "Didn't you hear him as we were leaving? He was
asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into
his report - said it was all publicity -"
But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky
Cauldron, where Ron, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be
traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the
Weasleys, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side;
Mr. Weasley started to ask
63
them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs.
Weasley's face.
Ron took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before
56
helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn't his favorite way to
travel.
C H-H A P T E RR F I v E
THE WHOMPING
WILLOW
he end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Ron's liking.
He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month
at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to
feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Weasleys and the sort of
welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.
On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner
that included all of Ron's favorite things, ending with a
mouthwatering treacle pudding. Ron and Ron rounded off the
evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they fiIled the kitchen
with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least
half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and
bed.
It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at
dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do.
65
Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and
quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast
in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a
stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ron's trunk to the car.
Ron couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a
rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of
course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.
"Not a word to Ron," he whispered to Ron as he opened the. trunk
and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the
luggage fitted easily.
57
When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the
back seat, where Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, and Ron were all sitting
comfortably side by side, and said, "Muggles do know more than we
give them credit for, don't they?" She and Ron got into the front seat,
which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. "I mean,
you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?"
Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard,
Ron turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to
wonder when he'd see it again when they were back Ron had
forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they
skidded to a halt in the yard so that Ron could run in for his
broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ron
shrieked that she'd left her diary. By the time she had clambered back
into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running
high.
* 66
Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.
"Ron, dear -"
"No, Ron -"
"No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I
installed - that'd get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds.
We'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -"
"I said no, Ron, not in broad daylight -"
They reached King's Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley
dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all
hurried into the station.
Ron had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky
part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn't
visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the
solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn't hurt, but it had to
be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.
"Ron first," said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock
58
overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear
casually through the barrier.
Ron strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next;
Ron and Ron followed.
"I'll take Ron and you two come right after us," Mrs. Weasley told
Ron and Ron, grabbing Ron's hand and setting off. In the blink of
an eye they were gone.
"Let's go together, we've only got a minute," Ron said to Ron.
Ron made sure that Ron's cage was safely wedged on top of his
trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt
61
perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo
powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and
walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet
away from it, they broke into a run and
CRASH.
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell
off with a loud thump, Ron was knocked off his feet, and Ron's
cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking
indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled,
"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?"
"Lost control of the trolley," Ron gasped, clutching his ribs as he
got up. Ron ran to pick up Ron, who was causing such a scene
that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the
surrounding crowd.
"Why can't we get through?" Ron hissed to Ron.
"I dunno -"
Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still
watching them.
59
"We're going to miss the train," Ron whispered. "I don't understand
why the gateway's sealed itself -"
Ron looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit
of his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine seconds ...
He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the
barrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.
Three seconds . . . two seconds ... one second ...
"It's gone," said Ron, sounding stunned. "The train's left. What if
Mum and Dad can't get back through to us? Have you got any
Muggle money?"
68
And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of
the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was
parked.
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
They heaved their luggage back in, put Ron on the back seat, and
got into the front.
"Check that no one's watching," said Ron, starting the ignition with
another tap of his wand. Ron stuck his head out of the window:
Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was
empty.
"Okay," he said.
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around
them vanished - and so did they. Ron could feel the seat vibrating
beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his
glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of
eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of
parked cars.
"Let's go," said Ron's voice from his right.
And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away,
60
dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London
lay, smoky and glittering, below them.
Then there was a popping noise and the car, Ron, and Ron
reappeared.
"Uh-oh," said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. "It's faulty -"
Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back
again.
"Hold on!" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler
* 7 0
ator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything
turned dull and foggy.
"Now what?" said Ron, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing
in on them from all sides.
"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in," said Ron.
"Dip back down again - quickly -"
They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their
seats, squinting at the ground.
"I can see it!" Ron yelled. "Right ahead - there!"
The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet
snake.
"Due north," said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard.
"Okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on
And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out
into a blaze of sunlight.
It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of
fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.
61
"All we've got to worry about now are airplanes," said Ron.
They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they
couldn't stop.
It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This,
thought Ron, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and
turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat
pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing
Ron's and Ron's jealous faces when they
* 71
landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of
Hogwarts castle.
They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and
farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different
view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green
fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive
with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.
Several uneventful hours later, however, Ron had to admit that
some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them
extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had
pulled off their sweaters, but Ron's T-shirt was sticking to the back
of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty
nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and
was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy
ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why
hadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?
"Can't be much further, can it?" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the
sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink.
"Ready for another check on the train?"
It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped
mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.
Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again,
but as he did so, the engine began to whine.
62
Ron and Ron exchanged nervous glances.
"It's probably just tired," said Ron. "It's never been this far before
......
12
And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing
louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were
blossoming in the blackness. Ron pulled his sweater back on, try
ing to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee
bly, as though in protest.
"Not far," said Ron, more to the car than to Ron, "not far
now," and he patted the dashboard nervously.
When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they
had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew.
"There!" Ron shouted, making Ron and Ron jump.
"Straight ahead!"
Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake,
stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.
But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed.
"Come on," Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit
tle shake, "nearly there, come on -"
The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un
der the hood. Ron found himself gripping the edges of his seat
very hard as they flew toward the lake.
The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Ron
saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below.
Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled
again.
"Come on," Ron muttered.
They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron
put his foot down.
There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died com
pletely.
"Uh-oh," said Ron, into the silence.
The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed,
heading straight for the solid castle wall.
"Noooooo!" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they
63
missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc,
soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then
out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.
Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of
his back pocket
"STOP! STOP!" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the
windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward
them
"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!" Ron bellowed, lunging for the
steering wheel, but too late
CRUNCH.
With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree
trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was
billowing from under the crumpled hood; Ron was shrieking in
terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Ron's head where he
had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing
groan.
"Are you okay?" Ron said urgently.
"My wand," said Ron, in a shaky voice. "Look at my wand -"
It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a
few splinters.
Ron opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend it
up at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment,
something hit his side of the car with the force of a
* Y4 *
charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an
equally heavy blow hit the roof.
"What's happen -?"
Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Ron looked around
64
just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree
they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and
its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could
reach.
"Aaargh!" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into
his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from
knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was
pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving
"Run for it!" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but
next second he had been knocked backward into Ron's lap by a
vicious uppercut from another branch.
"We're done for!" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the
floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted.
"Reverse!" Ron yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still
trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped
itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.
"That," panted Ron, "was close. Well done, car -"
The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp
clunks, the doors flew open and Ron felt his seat tip sideways: Next
thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told
him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Ron's
cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an
angry screech and sped off toward the castle
Y5
without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming,
the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.
"Come back!" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand.
"Dad'll kill me!"
But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its
exhaust.
"Can you believe our luck?" said Ron miserably, bending down to
65
pick up Ron. "Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get
one that hits back."
He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still
flailing its branches threateningly.
"Come on," said Ron wearily, "we'd better get up to the school
......
It wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold,
and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging
them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.
"I think the feast's already started," said Ron, dropping his trunk at
the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a
brightly lit window. "Hey - Ron - come and look - it's the Sorting!"
Ron hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great
Hall.
Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long,
crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle.
Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky
outside, sparkled with stars.
Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Ron saw a long
line of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall. Ron
* 76
was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley ha-ir.
Meanwhile, Professor Weasley, a bespectacled witch with her hair
in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a
stool before the newcomers.
Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new
students into the four Hogwarts houses (Weasley, Weasley,
Weasley, and Weasley). Ron well remembered putting it on,
exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it
muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared
that the hat was going to put him in Weasley, the house that had
turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had
66
ended up in Weasley, along with Ron, Ron, and the rest of the
Weasleys. Last term, Ron and Ron had helped Weasley win the
House Championship, beating Weasley for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the
hat on his head. Ron's eyes wandered past him to where Professor
Weasley, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff
table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the
candlelight. Several seats along, Ron saw Ron Weasley,
dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Weasley,
huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.
"Hang on. . . " Ron muttered to Ron. "There's an empty chair at the
staff table .... Where's Weasley?"
Professor Ron Weasley was Ron's least favorite teacher. Ron
also happened to be Weasley's least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic,
and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house
(Weasley), Weasley taught Potions.
"Maybe he's ill!" said Ron hopefully.
"Maybe he's left," said Ha-rry, "because he missed out on the Defense
Against Dark Arts job again!"
"Or he might have been sacked!" said Ron enthusiastically. "I mean,
everyone hates him -"
"Or maybe," said a very cold voice right behind them, "he's waiting to
hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train."
Ron spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze,
stood Ron Weasley. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked
nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he
was smiling in a way that told Ron he and Ron were in very deep
trouble.
"Follow me," said Weasley.
Not daring even to look at each other, Ron and Ron followed Weasley
up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with
67
flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great
Hall, but Weasley led them away from the warmth and light, down a
narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.
"In!" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and
pointing.
They entered Weasley's office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined
with shelves of large glass) ars, in which floated all manner of
revolting things Ron didn't really want to know the name of at the
moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Weasley closed the door
and turned to look at them.
"So," he said softly, "the train isn't good enough for the famous Ron
Weasley and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang,
did we, boys?"
"No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it -"
78
"Silence!" said Weasley coldly. "What have you done with the
car?"
Ron gulped. This wasn't the first time Weasley had given Ron the
impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he un
derstood, as Weasley unrolled today's issue of the Evening Prophet.
"You were seen," he hissed, showing them the headline: FLY
ING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read
aloud: "Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car
flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs.
Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet,
of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. I be
lieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?"
he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. "Dear,
dear ... his own son. . . "
Ron felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach by
one of the mad tree's larger branches. If anyone found out Mr.
Weasley had bewitched the car ... he hadn't thought of that ....
"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage
seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,"
Weasley went on.
"That tree did more damage to us than we -" Ron blurted out.
68
"Silence!" snapped Weasley again. "Most unfortunately, you are
not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with
me. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power.
You will wait here."
Ron and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Ron didn't
feel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to
look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a
shelf behind Weasley's desk. If Weasley had gone to fetch Professor
Weasley, head of Weasley House, they were hardly any better
off. She might be fairer than Weasley, but she was still extremely strict.
Ten minutes later, Weasley returned, and sure enough it was Professor
Weasley who accompanied him. Ron had seen Professor
Weasley angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten
just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry
before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Ron and Ron
both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where
flames suddenly erupted.
"Sit," she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.
"Explain," she said, her glasses glinting ominously.
Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station
refusing to let them through.
"
-so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn't get on the train."
"Why didn't you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?"
Professor Weasley said coldly to Ron.
Ron gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to
have done.
"I - I didn't think -"
"That," said Professor Weasley, "is obvious."
There was a knock on the office door and Weasley, now looking happier
69
than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor
Weasley.
Ron's whole body went numb. Weasley was looking unusually
grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and
*80*
Ron suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being
beaten up by the Whomping Willow.
There was a long silence. Then Weasley said, "Please explain why
you did this."
It would have been better if he had shouted. Ron hated the
disappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look
Weasley in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told
Weasley everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the
bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to
find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Weasley
would see through this at once, but Weasley asked no questions
about the car. When Ron had finished, he merely continued to peer
at them through his spectacles.
"We'll go and get our stuff," said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.
"What are you talking about, Weasley?" barked Professor
Weasley.
"Well, you're expelling us, aren't you?" said Ron.
Ron looked quickly at Weasley.
"Not today, Mr. Weasley," said Weasley. "But I must impress upon
both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to
both your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything
like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you."
Weasley looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his
throat and said, "Professor Weasley, these boys have flouted the
Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious
damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -"
70
* 8i
"It will be for Professor Weasley to decide on these boys'
punishments, Ron," said Weasley calmly. "They are in her
House and are therefore her responsibility." He turned to Professor
Weasley. "I must go back to the feast, Ron, I've got to give
out a few notices. Come, Ron, there's a delicious-looking cus
tard tart I want to sample -"
Weasley shot a look of pure venom at Ron and Ron as he allowed
himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Pro
fessor Weasley, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.
"You'd better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you're
bleeding."
"Not much," said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with
his sleeve. "Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -"
"The Sorting Ceremony is over," said Professor Weasley.
"Your sister is also in Weasley."
"Oh, good," said Ron.
"And speaking of Weasley -" Professor Weasley said
sharply, but Ron cut in: "Professor, when we took the car, term
hadn't started, so - so Weasley shouldn't really have points
taken from it - should it?" he finished, watching her anxiously.
Professor Weasley gave him a piercing look, but he was sure
she had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.
"I will not take any points from Weasley," she said, and
Ron's heart lightened considerably. "But you will both get a de
tention."
It was better than Ron had expected. As for Weasley's
writing to the Weasleys, that was nothing. Ron knew perfectly
well they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn't
squashed him flat.
82
Professor Weasley raised her wand again and pointed it at Weasley's
desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of-iced
pumpkin juice appeared with a pop.
"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory," she
said. "I must also return to the feast."
71
When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.
"I thought we'd had it," he said, grabbing a sandwich.
"So did I," said Ron, taking one, too.
"Can you believe our luck, though?" said Ron thickly through a
mouthful of chicken and ham. "Ron and Ron must've flown that
car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them." He swallowed
and took another huge bite. "Why couldn't we get through the barrier?"
Ron shrugged. "We'll have to watch our step from now on, though,"
he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. "Wish we could've
gone up to the feast ......
"She didn't want us showing off," said Ron sagely. "Doesn't want
people to think it's clever, arriving by flying car."
When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate
kept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar
path to Weasley Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the
feast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking
suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last
they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Weasley
Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a
pink silk dress.
"Password?" she said as they approached.
"Er -" said Ron.
They didn't know the new year's password, not having met a
Weasley prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard
hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Ron dashing toward
them.
"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors -
someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying car
"Well, we haven't been expelled," Ron assured her.
"You're not telling me you did fly here?" said Ron, sounding
72
almost as severe as Professor Weasley.
"Skip the lecture," said Ron impatiently, "and tell us the new
password."
"It's `wattlebird,"' said Ron impatiently, "but that's not the point -
"
Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady
swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as
though the whole of Weasley House was still awake, packed into
the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and
squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through
the portrait hole to pull Ron and Ron inside, leaving Ron to
scramble in after then-t.
"Brilliant!" yelled Ron Weasley. "Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a
car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that
one for years -"
"Good for you," said a fifth year Ron had never spoken to; someone
was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon;
Ron and Ron pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said
together, "Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?"
84
Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Ron could
see one person who didn't look happy at all. Ron was visible over
the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to
get near enough to start telling them off. Ron nudged Ron in the
ribs and nodded in Ron's direction. Ron got the point at once.
"Got to get upstairs - bit tired," he said, and the two of them started
pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room,
which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.
"'Night," Ron called back to Ron, who was wearing a scowl
just like Ron's.
They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still
having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase.
73
They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of
their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS.
They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters
hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had
been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.
Ron grinned guiltily at Ron.
"I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but ='
The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year
Weasley boys, Ron Weasley, Ron Ron, and Ron
Weasley.
"Unbelievable!" beamed Ron.
"Cool," said Ron.
"Amazing," said Ron, awestruck.
Ron couldn't help it. He grinned, too.
* 85 *

Ron Weasley
he next day, however, Ron barely grinned once. Things started to go
downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables
were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of
toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling
(today, a dull, cloudy gray). Ron and Ron sat down at the Weasley
table next to Ron, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires
propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the
way she said "Morning," which told Ron that she was still
disapproving of the way they had arrived. Ron Weasley, on the
other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Ron was a round-faced and
accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Ron had ever
met.
"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot."
74
Ron had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was
a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls
86
streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the
chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Ron's head
and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Ron's jug,
spraying them all with milk and feathers.
"Enrol!" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Ron
slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red
envelope in his beak.
"Oh, no -" Ron gasped.
"It's all right, he's still alive," said Ron, prodding Ron gently with
the tip of her finger.
"It's not that - it's that."
Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to
Ron, but Ron and Ron were both looking at it as though they
expected it to explode.
"What's the matter?" said Ron.
"She's - she's sent me a Howler," said Ron faintly.
"You'd better open it, Ron," said Ron in a timid whisper. "It'll be
worse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and" -
he gulped - "it was horrible."
Ron looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.
"What's a Howler?" he said.
But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to
smoke at the corners.
75
"Open it," Ron urged. "It'll all be over in a few minutes -"
Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Ron's
beak, and slit it open. Ron stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split
second later, Ron knew why. He thought for a moment it had
exploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the
ceiling.
8 _
"- E CAR, I WO ULDN'T HAVE BEEN S URSTEALING
THE
PRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET
HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO
THINK WHAT YOUR RonHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN
WE SAW IT WAS GONE -"
Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the
plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the
stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see
who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that
only his crimson forehead could be seen.
"- LETTER FROM Weasley LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT
YOUR RonHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING
YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND Ron COULD
BOTH HAVE DIED -"
Ron had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He
tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was
making his eardrums throb.
"-ABSOLUTELYDISGUSRon - YOUR RonHER'S FACING AN
INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF
YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU
STRAIGHT BACK HOME."
A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's
hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Ron and Ron sat
76
stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few
people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.
Ron closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top
of Ron's head.
* 88
"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -"
"Don't tell me I deserved it," snapped Ron.
Ron pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt.
Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley had done for him over the summer ...
But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor Weasley was
moving along the Weasley table, handing out course schedules.
Ron took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the
Hufepuffs first.
Ron, Ron, and Ron left the castle together, crossed the
vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical
plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing:
Ron seemed to think they had now been punished enough and
was being perfectly friendly again.
As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class
standing outside, waiting for Professor Weasley. Ron, Ron, and
Ron had only just joined them when she came striding into view
across the lawn, accompanied by Ron Weasley. Professor
Weasley's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt,
Ron spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its
branches now in slings.
Professor Weasley was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over
her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her
clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Ron faint.
Ron Weasley, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of
turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise
hat with gold trimming.
77
"Oh, hello there!" he called, beaming around at the assembled
89
students. "Just been showing Professor Weasley the right way to doctor
a Whomping Willow! But I don't want you running away with the idea
that I'm better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met
several of these exotic plants on my travels . . ."
"Greenhouse three today, chaps!" said Professor Weasley, who was
looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.
There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in
greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting
and dangerous plants. Professor Weasley took a large key from her belt
and unlocked the door. Ron caught a whiff of damp earth and
fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrellasized
flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron
and Ron inside when Weasley's hand shot out.
"Ron! I've been wanting a word - you don't mind if he's a couple of
minutes late, do you, Professor Weasley?"
Judging by Professor Weasley's scowl, she did mind, but Weasley said,
"That's the ticket," and closed the greenhouse door in her face.
"Ron," said Weasley, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight
as he shook his head. "Ron, Ron, Ron."
Completely nonplussed, Ron said nothing.
"When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked
myself."
Ron had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so
when Weasley went on, "Don't know when I've been more shocked.
Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd
done it. Stood out a mile. Ron, Ron, Ron."
It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant
teeth even when he wasn't talking.
78
90
"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?" said Weasley. "Gave
you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and
you couldn't wait to do it again."
"Oh, no, Professor, see -"
"Ron, Ron, Ron," said Weasley, reaching out and grasping
his shoulder. "I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you've
had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, be
cause it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man,
you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm
down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you're older. Yes,
yes, I know what you're thinking! 'It's all right for him, he's an in
ternationally famous wizard already!' But when I was twelve, I was
just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, Id say I was even
more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't
they? All that business with He-\"o-Must-Not-Be-Named!" He
glanced at the lightning scar on Ron's forehead. "I know, I
know - it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's Most
Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it's a
start, Ron, it's a start."
He gave Ron a hearty wink and strode off. Ron stood
stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to
be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside.
Professor Weasley was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen
ter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear
muffs were lying on the bench. When Ron had taken his place
between Ron and Ron, she said, "We'll be repotting Man
drakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man
drake?"
To nobody's surprise, Ron's hand was first into the air.
s1
"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative," said Ron,
sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. "It is
used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their
original state."
"Excellent. Ten points to Weasley," said Professor Weasley. "The
Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also,
however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?"
79
Ron's hand narrowly missed Ron's glasses as it shot up again.
"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it," she said
promptly.
"Precisely. Take another ten points," said Professor Weasley. "Now, the
Mandrakes we have here are still very young."
She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone
shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants,
purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite
unremarkable to Ron, who didn't have the slightest idea what
Ron meant by the "cry" of the Mandrake.
"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs," said Professor Weasley.
There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't
pink and fluffy.
"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely
covered," said Professor Weasley. "When it is safe to remove them, I
will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on."
Ron snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound
completely. Professor Weasley put the pink, fluffy pair over her own
ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants
firmly, and pulled hard.
*92*
Ron let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.
Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out
of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had
pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his
lungs.
Professor Weasley took a large plant pot from under the table and
plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until
only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Weasley dusted off her
hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.
80
"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet," she
said calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than water
a begonia. "However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as
I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your
earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your
attention when it is time to pack up.
"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the
sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it's
teething."
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making
it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her
shoulder.
Ron, Ron, and Ron were joined at their tray by a curly-haired
Weasley boy Ron knew by sight but had never spoken to.
"Ron Weasley," he said brightly, shaking Ron by the hand.
"Know who you are, of course, the famous Ron Weasley... And you're
Ron Weasley - always top in everything"
* 9%
(Ron beamed as she had her hand shaken too) "- and Ron
Weasley. Wasn't that your flying car?"
Ron didn't smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.
"That Weasley's something, isn't he?" said Ron happily as they
began fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. "Awfully
brave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id been
cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and -
zap - just fantastic.
"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I
am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed,
but since I made her read Weasley's books I think she's begun to see
how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . ."
After that they didn't have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were
81
back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor
Weasley had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. The Mandrakes
didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back
into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and
gnashed their teeth; Ron spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a
particularly fat one into a pot.
By the end of the class, Ron, like everyone else, was sweaty,
aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for
a quick wash and then the Weasleys hurried off to Transfiguration.
Professor Weasley's classes were always hard work, but today
was especially difficult. Everything Ron had learned last year
seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was
supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed
* 94
to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the
desktop avoiding his wand.
Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand
with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond
repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time
Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke
that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron
accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a
new one. Professor Weasley wasn't pleased.
Ron was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung
sponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who
was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.
"Stupid - useless - thing -"
"Write home for another one," Ron suggested as the wand let off a
volley of bangs like a firecracker.
"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back," said Ron, stuffing the now
hissing wand into his bag. " `It's your own fault your wand got snapped -
'"
82
They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved by
Ron's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had
produced in Transfiguration.
"What've we got this afternoon?" said Ron, hastily changing the
subject.
"Defense Against the Dark Arts," said Ron at once.
"Why, "demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, "have you outlined all
Weasley's lessons in little hearts?"
Ron snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.
* 95 *
They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard.
Ron sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages
with Vampires again. Ron and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for
several minutes before Ron became aware that he was being closely
watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd
seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Ron as though
transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle
camera, and the moment Ron looked at him, he went bright red.
"All right, Ron? I'm -I'm Ron Weasley," he said breathlessly, taking
a tentative step forward. "I'm in Weasley, too. D'you think - would it
be all right if - can I have a picture?" he said, raising the camera
hopefully.
"A picture?" Ron repeated blankly.
"So I can prove I've met you," said Ron Weasley eagerly, edging
further forward. "I know all about you. Everyone's told me. About
how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he
disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on
your forehead" (his eyes raked Ron's hairline) "and a boy in my
dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll
move." Ron drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said,
"It's amazing here, isn't it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do
was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad's a milkman, he
couldn't believe it either. So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home
83
to him. And it'd be really good if I had one of you" - he looked
imploringly at Ron - "maybe your friend could take it and I could
stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?"
96
"Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Weasley?"
Loud and scathing, Ron Weasley's voice echoed around the
courtyard. He had stopped right behind Ron, flanked, as he always
was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Weasley and
Weasley.
"Everyone line up!" Weasley roared to the crowd. "Ron Weasley's
giving out signed photos!"
"No, I'm not," said Ron angrily, his fists clenching. "Shut up,
Weasley."
"You're just jealous," piped up Ron, whose entire body was about
as thick as Weasley's neck.
`jealous?"said Weasley, who didn't need to shout anymore: half the
courtyard was listening in. "Of what? I don't want a foul scar right
across my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut open
makes you that special, myself."
Weasley and Weasley were sniggering stupidly.
"Eat slugs, Weasley," said Ron angrily. Weasley stopped laughing and
started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.
"Be careful, Weasley," sneered Weasley. "You don't want to start any
trouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away from
school." He put on a shrill, piercing voice. "Ifyou put another toe
out of line' - "
A knot of Weasley fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this.
"Weasley would like a signed photo, Weasley," smirked Weasley. "It'd
be worth more than his family's whole house -"
84
Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Ron shut Voyages
with Vampires with a snap and whispered, "Look out!"
"What's all this, what's all this?" Ron Weasley was striding
* 97
toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. "Who's giv
ing out signed photos?"
Ron started to speak but he was cut short as Weasley flung an
arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, "Shouldn't have
asked! We meet again, Ron!"
Pinned to Weasley's side and burning with humiliation, Ron
saw Weasley slide smirking back into the crowd.
"Come on then, Mr. Weasley," said Weasley, beaming at Ron.
"A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it
for you."
Ron fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell
rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.
"Off you go, move along there," Weasley called to the crowd,
and he set off back to the castle with Ron, who was wishing he
knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.
"A word to the wise, Ron," said Weasley paternally as they
entered the building through a side door. "I covered up for you
back there with young Weasley - if he was photographing me,
too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so
much . . . ."
Deaf to Ron's stammers, Weasley swept him down a corridor
lined with staring students and up a staircase.
"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of
your career isn't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Ron, to be
frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need to
keep a stack handy wherever you go, but" - he gave a little chor
tle - "I don't think you're quite there yet."
They had reached Weasley's classroom and he let Ron go at
98
last. Ron yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very
back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of
Weasley's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the
real thing.
85
The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Ron sat
down on either side of Ron.
"You could've fried an egg on your face" said Ron. "You'd better hope
Weasley doesn't meet Ron, or they'll be starting a Ron Weasley fan
club."
"Shut up," snapped Ron. The last thing he needed was for Weasley
to hear the phrase "Ron Weasley fan club."
When the whole class was seated, Weasley cleared his throat loudly
and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Ron Weasley's
copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking
portrait on the front.
"Me," he said, pointing at it and winking as well. "Ron Weasley,
Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force
Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most-
Charming-Smile Award - but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of
the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!"
He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.
"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -well done. I
thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about
just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -"
When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of
the class and said, "You have thirty minutes - start - now!"
Ron looked down at his paper and read:
1. What is Ron Weasley 's favorite color?
2. What is Ron Weasley's secret ambition?
3. What, in your opinion, is Ron Weasley's greatest
achievement to date?
86
On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:
54. When is Ron Weasley's birthday, and what would his
ideal gift be?
Half an hour later, Weasley collected the papers and rifled through
them in front of the class.
"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is
lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read
Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter
twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all
magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large
bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!"
He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at
Weasley with an expression of disbelief on his face; Ron
Weasley and Ron Ron, who were sitting in front, were shaking
with silent laughter. Ron, on the other hand, was listening to
Weasley with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her
name.
". . . but Miss Ron Weasley knew my secret ambition is to rid the
world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good
girl! In fact" - he flipped her paper over - "full marks! Where is Miss
Ron Weasley?"
*100*
Ron raised a trembling hand.
"Excellent!" beamed Weasley. "Quite excellent! Take ten points for
Weasley! And so - to business -"
He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.
"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your
worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst
I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm."
In spite of himself, Ron leaned around his pile of books for a better
87
look at the cage. Weasley placed a hand on the cover. Ron and
Ron had stopped laughing now. Ron was cowering in his front
row seat.
"I must ask you not to scream," said Weasley in a low voice. "It might
provoke them."
As the whole class held its breath, Weasley whipped off the cover.
"Yes," he said dramatically. "Freshly caught Cornish pixies. "
Ron Weasley couldn't control himself. He let out a snort of
laughter that even Weasley couldn't mistake for a scream of terror.
"Yes?" He smiled at Ron.
"Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they?" Ron
choked.
"Don't be so sure!" said Weasley, waggling a finger annoyingly at
Ron. "Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!"
The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed
faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies
arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they
*101*
had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and
making bizarre faces at the people nearest them.
"Right, then," Weasley said loudly. "Let's see what you make of
them!" And he opened the cage.
It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.
Two of them seized Ron by the ears and lifted him into the air.
Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row
with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more
effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and
sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures
from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books
and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the
88
class was sheltering under desks and Ron was swinging from the
iron chandelier in the ceiling.
"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,"
Weasley shouted.
He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,
"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!"
It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and
threw it out of the window, too. Weasley gulped and dived under his
own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Ron, who fell a
second later as the chandelier gave way.
The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative
calm that followed, Weasley straightened up, caught sight of Ron,
Ron, and Ron, who were almost at the door, and said, "Well, I'll
ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage." He
swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.
*102*
"Can you believe him?" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit
him painfully on the ear.
"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience," said Ron,
immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and
stuffing them back into their cage.
"Hands on? "said Ron, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of
reach with its tongue out. "Ron, he didn't have a clue what he
was doing -"
"Rubbish," said Ron. "You've read his books - look at all those
amazing things he's done -"
"He says he's done," Ron muttered.
arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight
whenever he saw Ron Weasley coming down a corridor. Harder
89
to avoid was Ron Weasley, who seemed to have memorized Ron's
schedule. Nothing seemed to give Ron a bigger thrill than to say, "All
right, Ron?" six or seven times a day and hear, "Hello, Ron," back,
however exasperated Ron sounded when he said it.
Ron was still angry with Ron about the disasterous car journey
and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday
morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old
Professor Weasley squarely between the eyes, creating a large,
throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and
another, Ron was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and
Ron were planning to visit Weasley on Saturday morning. Ron,
however, was shaken awake several hours earlier
*104*
than he would have liked by Ron Weasley, Captain of the Weasley
Quidditch team.
"Whassamatter?" said Ron groggily.
"Quidditch practice!" said Weasley. "Come on!"
Ron squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across
the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn't
understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were
making.
"Ron," Ron croaked. "It's the crack of dawn."
"Exactly," said Weasley. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the
moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. "It's part
of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,"
said Weasley heartily. "None of the other teams have started training yet;
we're going to be first off the mark this year -"
Yawning and shivering slightly, Ron climbed out of bed and tried to
find his Quidditch robes.
"Good man," said Weasley. "Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.
90
When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for
warmth, Ron scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and
went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two
Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when
there was a clatter behind him and Ron Weasley came dashing down
the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and
something clutched in his hand.
"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Ron! Look what
I've got here! I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -"
*105*
Ron looked bemusedly at the photograph Ron was brandishing
under his nose.
A moving, black-and-white Weasley was tugging hard on an arm
Ron recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his
photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be
dragged into view. As Ron watched, Weasley gave up and
slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.
"Will you sign it?" said Ron eagerly.
"No," said Ron flatly, glancing around to check that the room was
really deserted. "Sorry, Ron, I'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice -"
He climbed through the portrait hole.
"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I've never watched a Quidditch game
before!"
Ron scrambled through the hole after him.
"It'll be really boring," Ron said quickly, but Ron ignored him, his
face shining with excitement.
"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't
you, Ron? Weren't you?" said Ron, trotting alongside him. "You
must be brilliant. I've never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own
broom? Is that the best one there is?"
91
Ron didn't know how to get rid of him. It was like having an
extremely talkative shadow.
"I don't really understand Quidditch," said Ron breathlessly. "Is it
true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock
people off their brooms?"
"Yes," said Ron heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated
rules of Quidditch. "They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters
), *106*
on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their
side. Ron and Ron Weasley are the Weasley Beaters."
"And what are the other balls for?" Ron asked, tripping down a
couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Ron.
"Well, the Quafe - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scores
goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other
and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch -
they're three long poles with hoops on the end."
"And the fourth ball -"
"- is the Golden Snitch," said Ron, "and it's very small, very fast, and
difficult to catch. But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a
game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. And
whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra
hundred and fifty points."
"And you're the Weasley Seeker, aren't you?" said Ron in awe.
"Yes," said Ron as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenched
grass. "And there's the Keeper, too. He guards the goal
posts. That's it, really."
But Ron didn't stop questioning Ron all the way down the sloping
lawns to the Quidditch field, and Ron only shook him off when he
reached the changing rooms; Ron called after him in a piping voice,
"I'll go and get a good seat, Ron!" and hurried off to the stands.
92
The rest of the Weasley team were already in the changing room.
Weasley was the only person who looked truly awake. Ron and Ron
Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year
Ron Weasley, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind
her. Her fellow Chasers, Ron
*107*
Weasley and Ron Ronson, were yawning side by side opposite
them.
"There you are, Ron, what kept you?" said Weasley briskly. "Now, I
wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field,
because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program,
which I really think will make all the difference ....
Weasley was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which
were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks.
He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to
wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Weasley launched into a
speech about his new tactics, Ron Weasley's head drooped right
onto Ron Weasley's shoulder and he began to snore.
The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was
another board under that, and a third under that one. Ron sank into
a stupor as Weasley droned on and on.
"So," said Weasley, at long last, jerking Ron from a wistful fantasy
about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up
at the castle. "Is that clear? Any questions?"
"I've got a question, Ron," said Ron, who had woken with a
start. "Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we
were awake?"
Weasley wasn't pleased.
"Now, listen here, you lot," he said, glowering at them all. "We
should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the best
team. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control -
"
93
*108*
Ron shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the
hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that
Weasley had been a player short and had suffered their worst
defeat in three hundred years.
Weasley took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat
was clearly still torturing him.
"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let's go and
put our new theories into practice!" Weasley shouted, seizing his
broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stifflegged
and still yawning, his team followed.
They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up
completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the
stadium. As Ron walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Ron
sitting in the stands.
"Aren't you finished yet?" called Ron incredulously.
"Haven't even started," said Ron, looking jealously at the toast and
marmalade Ron and Ron had brought out of the Great Hall.
"Weasley's been teaching us new moves."
He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into
the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more
effectively than Weasley's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the
Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed,
racing Ron and Ron.
"What's that funny clicking noise?" called Ron as they hurtled around
the corner.
Ron looked into the stands. Ron was sitting in one of the highest
seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound
strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.
*io9*
94
"Look this way, Ron! This way!" he cried shrilly.
"Who's that?" said Ron.
"No idea," Ron lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far
away as possible from Ron.
"What's going on?" said Weasley, frowning, as he skimmed through the
air toward them. "Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it.
He could be a Weasley spy, trying to find out about our new training
program."
"He's in Weasley," said Ron quickly.
"And the Weasleys don't need a spy, Ron," said Ron.
"What makes you say that?" said Weasley testily.
"Because they're here in person," said Ron, pointing.
Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks
in their hands.
"I don't believe it!" Weasley hissed in outrage. "I booked the field for
today! We'll see about this!"
Weasley shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to
in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Ron, Ron, and
Ron followed.
"Weasley!" Weasley bellowed at the Weasley Captain. "This is our practice
time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!"
Ron Weasley was even larger than Weasley. He had a look of trollish
cunning on his face as he replied, "Plenty of room for all of us, Weasley."
Ron, Ron, and Ron had come over, too. There were no girls
on the Weasley team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the
Weasleys, leering to a man.
"But I booked the field!" said Weasley, positively spitting with rage. "I
booked it!"
95
*110*
"Ah," said Weasley. "But I've got a specially signed note here from
Professor Weasley. `I, Professor S. Weasley, give the Weasley team
permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to
train their new Seeker."'
"You've got a new Seeker?" said Weasley, distracted. "Where?"
And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh,
smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Ron
Weasley.
"Aren't you Ron Weasley's son?" said Ron, looking at Weasley with
dislike.
"Funny you should mention Ron's father," said Weasley as the whole
Weasley team smiled still more broadly. "Let me show you the
generous gift he's made to the Weasley team."
All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished,
brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the
words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Weasleys'
noses in the early morning sun.
"Very latest model. Only came out last month," said Weasley carelessly,
flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. "I believe it outstrips
the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old
Cleansweeps" - he smiled nastily at Ron and Ron, who were both
clutching Cleansweep Fives - "sweeps the board with them."
None of the Weasley team could think of anything to say for a
moment. Weasley was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced
to slits.
"Oh, look," said Weasley. "A field invasion."
Ron and Ron were crossing the grass to see what was going on.
*111*
96
"What's happening?" Ron asked Ron. "Why aren't you playing? And
what's he doing here?"
He was looking at Weasley, taking in his Weasley Quidditch robes.
"I'm the new Weasley Seeker, Weasley," said Weasley, smugly.
"Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our
team.
Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of
him.
"Good, aren't they?" said Weasley smoothly. "But perhaps the
Weasley team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms,
too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum
would bid for them."
The Weasley team howled with laughter.
"At least no one on the Weasley team had to buy their way in," said
Ron sharply. "They got in on pure talent."
The smug look on Weasley's face flickered.
"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood," he spat.
Ron knew at once that Weasley had said something really bad
because there was an instant uproar at his words. Weasley had to dive in
front of Weasley to stop Ron and Ron jumping on him, Ron
shrieked, "How dare you!" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes,
pulled out his wand, yelling, "You'll pay for that one, Weasley!" and
pointed it furiously under Weasley's arm at Weasleys face.
A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot
out of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach and
sending him reeling backward onto the grass.
12
"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?" squealed Ron.
Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he
97
gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth
onto his lap.
The Weasley team were paralyzed with laughter. Weasley was doubled
up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Weasley was on all
fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Weasleys were
gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs.
Nobody seemed to want to touch him.
"We'd better get him to Weasley's, it's nearest," said Ron to
Ron, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up
by the arms.
"What happened, Ron? What happened? Is he ill? But you can
cure him, can't you?" Ron had run down from his seat and was now
dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave
and more slugs dribbled down his front.
"Oooh," said Ron, fascinated and raising his camera. "Can you hold
him still, Ron?"
"Get out of the way, Ron!" said Ron angrily. He and Ron
supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward
the edge of the forest.
"Nearly there, Ron," said Ron as the gamekeeper's cabin came
into view. "You'll be all right in a minute - almost there -"
They were within twenty feet of Weasley's house when the front door
opened, but it wasn't Weasley who emerged. Ron Weasley,
wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.
"Quick, behind here," Ron hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby
bush. Ron followed, somewhat reluctantly.
*113* *
"It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing!" Weasley was
saying loudly to Weasley. "If you need help, you know where I am! I'll
let you have a copy of my book. I'm surprised you haven't already got
one - I'll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!" And he
strode away toward the castle.
98
Ron waited until Weasley was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of
the bush and up to Weasley's front door. They knocked urgently.
Weasley appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression
brightened when he saw who it was.
"Bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me - come in, come in -
thought you mighta bin Professor Weasley back again -"
Ron and Ron supported Ron over the threshold into the oneroomed
cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire
crackling merrily in the other. Weasley didn't seem perturbed by Ron's
slug problem, which Ron hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a
chair.
"Better out than in," he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in
front of him. "Get 'em all up, Ron."
"I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop," said
Ron anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. "That's a
difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -"
Weasley was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Ron,
was slobbering over Ron.
"What did Weasley want with you, Weasley?" Ron asked, scratching
Ron's ears.
"Givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well," growled
*114*
Weasley, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and
setting down the teapot. "Like I don' know. An' bangin' on about
some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I'll eat my
kettle."
It was most unlike Weasley to criticize a Hogwarts' teacher, and Ron
looked at him in surprise. Ron, however, said in a voice
somewhat higher than usual, "I think you're being a bit unfair.
Professor Weasley obviously thought he was the best man for
99
the job -"
"He was the on' man for the job," said Weasley, offering them a Y
plate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin.
"An' I mean the on' one. Gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer Y
the Dark Arts job. People aren't too keen ter take it on, see. They're
startin' ter think it's jinxed. No one's lasted long fer a while now. So
tell me," said Weasley, jerking his head at Ron. "Who was he tryin' ter
curse?"
"Weasley called Ron something - it must've been really bad,
because everyone went wild."
"It was bad," said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking
pale and sweaty. "Weasley called her `Mudblood,' Weasley -"
Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their
appearance. Weasley looked outraged.
"He didn'!" he growled at Ron.
"He did," she said. "But I don't know what it means. I could tell it
was really rude, of course -"
"It's about the most insulting thing he could think of," gasped Ron,
coming back up. "Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is
Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are
*115*
some wizards - like Weasley's family - who think they're better than
everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood." He
gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He
threw it into the basin and continued, "I mean, the rest of us know it
doesn't make any difference at all. Look at Ron Weasley -
he's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way
up."
"An' they haven't invented a spell our Ron can' do," said Weasley
proudly, making Ron go a brilliant shade of magenta.
100
"It's a disgusting thing to call someone," said Ron, wiping his sweaty
brow with a shaking hand. "Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It's
ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we
hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out."
He retched and ducked out of sight again.
"Well, I don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse him, Ron," said Weasley
loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. "Bu' maybe it
was a good thing yer wand backfired. 'Spect Ron Weasley
would've come marchin' up ter school if yeh'd cursed his son. Least
yer not in trouble."
Ron would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worse
than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn't; Weasley's
treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together.
"Ron," said Weasley abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.
"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I've heard you've bin givin' out signed
photos. How come I haven't got one?"
Furious, Ron wrenched his teeth apart.
"I have not been giving out signed photos," he said hotly. "If
Weasley's still spreading that around -"
*116*
But then he saw that Weasley was laughing.
"I'm on'y jokin'," he said, patting Ron genially on the back and
sending him face first into the table. "I knew yeh hadn't really. I told
Weasley yeh didn' need teh. Yer more famous than him without
tryin'."
"Bet he didn't like that," said Ron, sitting up and rubbing his chin.
"Don' think he did," said Weasley, his eyes twinkling. "An' then I told
him Id never read one o' his books an' he decided ter go. Treacle
fudge, Ron?" he added as Ron reappeared.
101
"No thanks," said Ron weakly. "Better not risk it."
"Come an' see what I've bin growin'," said Weasley as Ron and
Ron finished the last of their tea.
In the small vegetable patch behind Weasley's house were a dozen of
the largest pumpkins Ron had ever seen. Each was the size of a
large boulder.
"Gettin' on well, aren't they?" said Weasley happily. "Fer the Halloween
feast ... should be big enough by then."
"What've you been feeding them?" said Ron.
Weasley looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.
"Well, I've bin givin' them - you know - a bit o' help -"
Ron noticed Weasley's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back
wall of the cabin. Ron had had reason to believe before now that
this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong
impression that Weasley's old school wand was concealed inside it.
Weasley wasn't supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from
Hogwarts in his third year, but Ron had never found out why -any
mention of the matter and Weasley would clear his
*117*
throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was
changed.
"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?" said Ron, halfway
between disapproval and amusement. "Well, you've done a good job on
them."
"That's what yer little sister said," said Weasley, nodding at Ron. "Met
her jus' yesterday." Weasley looked sideways at Ron, his beard
twitching. "Said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I reckon
she was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house." He
winked at Ron. "If yeh ask me, she wouldn' say no ter a signed -"
"Oh, shut up," said Ron. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground
102
was sprayed with slugs.
"Watch it!" Weasley roared, pulling Ron away from his precious
pumpkins.
It was nearly lunchtime and as Ron had only had one bit of treacle
fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said
good-bye to Weasley and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing
occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.
They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang
out, "There you are, Weasley - Weasley." Professor Weasley was
walking toward them, looking stern. "You will both do your detentions
this evening."
"What're we doing, Professor?" said Ron, nervously suppressing a
burp.
"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Weasley,"
said Professor Weasley. "And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease."
*118*
Ron gulped. Ron Weasley, the caretaker, was loathed by every student
in the school.
"And you, Weasley, will be helping Professor Weasley answer his fan
mail," said Professor Weasley.
"Oh n - Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too?" said Ron
desperately.
"Certainly not," said Professor Weasley, raising her eyebrows.
"Professor Weasley requested you particularly. Eight o'clock sharp,
both of you."
Ron and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest
gloom, Ron behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-schoolrules
sort of expression. Ron didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as
much as he'd thought. Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal.
"Weasley'll have me there all night," said Ron heavily. "No magic! There
103
must be about a hundred cups in that room. I'm no good at Muggle
cleaning."
"I'd swap anytime," said Ron hollowly. "I've had loads of practice
with the Weasleys. Answering Weasley's fan mail ... he'll be a
nightmare ......
Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no
time, it was five minutes to eight, and Ron was dragging his feet
along the second-floor corridor to Weasley's office. He gritted his
teeth and knocked.
The door flew open at once. Weasley beamed down at him.
"Ah, here's the scalawag!" he said. "Come in, Ron, come in -"
Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were
countless framed photographs of Weasley. He had even signed a few
of them. Another large pile lay on his desk.
"You can address the envelopes!" Weasley told Ron, as though
this was a huge treat. "This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her -
huge fan of mine -"
The minutes snailed by. Ron let Weasley's voice wash over him,
occasionally saying, "Mmm" and "Right" and "Yeah." Now and then
he caught a phrase like, "Fame's a fickle friend, Ron," or "Celebrity
is as celebrity does, remember that."
The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the
many moving faces of Weasley watching him. Ron moved his
aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out
Veronica Smethley's address. It must be nearly time to leave, Ron
thought miserably, please let it be nearly time...
And then he heard something - something quite apart from the
spitting of the dying candles and Weasley's prattle about his fans.
It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of
breathtaking, ice-cold venom.
104
"Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you . .
. ."
Ron gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica
Smethley's street.
"What?" he said loudly.
"I know!" said Weasley. "Six solid months at the top of the bestseller
list! Broke all records!"
"No," said Ron frantically. "That voice!"
"Sorry?" said Weasley, looking puzzled. "What voice?"
"That - that voice that said - didn't you hear it?"
Weasley was looking at Ron in high astonishment.
* 3-2o *
"What are you talking about, Ron? Perhaps you're getting a litde
drowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We've been here nearly four
hours! Id never have believed it - the time's flown, hasn't it?"
Ron didn't answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again,
but there was no sound now except for Weasley telling him he mustn't
expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed,
Ron left.
It was so late that the Weasley common room was almost empty.
Ron went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn't back yet. Ron
pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron
arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into
the darkened room.
"My muscles have all seized up," he groaned, sinking on his bed.
"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was
satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award
for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was
it with Weasley?"
105
Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Ron, Ron, and Ron,
Ron told Ron exactly what he had heard.
"And Weasley said he couldn't hear it?" said Ron. Ron could see
him frowning in the moonlight. "D'you think he was lying? But I don't
get it - even someone invisible would've had to open the door."
"I know," said Ron, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the
canopy above him. "I don't get it either."
* 12-1 *
122
October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle.
Ron Weasley, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among
the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left
the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ron Weasley,
who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Ron. The
steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole
head was on fire.
Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on
end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Weasley's
pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Ron Weasley's enthusiasm for
regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Ron
was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before
Halloween, returning to Weasley Tower, drenched to the skin and
splattered with mud..
123
Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session.
Ron and Ron, who had been spying on the Weasley team, had seen for
themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They
reported that the Weasley team was no more than seven greenish blurs,
shooting through the air like missiles.
As Ron squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody
who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Ron, the ghost
of Weasley Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering
under his breath, ". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that .
. ."
"Hello, Ron," said Ron.
106
"Hello, hello," said Nearly Headless Ron, starting and looking round. He
wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff,
which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He
was pale as smoke, and Ron could see right through him to the dark sky
and torrential rain outside.
"You look troubled, young Weasley," said Ron, folding a transparent letter as
he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.
"So do you," said Ron.
"Ah," Nearly Headless Ron waved an elegant hand, "a matter of no
importance. . . . It's not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I'd
apply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -"
In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.
"But you would think, wouldn't you," he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter
back out of his pocket, "that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a
blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?"
124
"Oh - yes," said Ron, who was obviously supposed to agree.
"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean,
and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great
deal of pain and ridicule. However -" Nearly Headless Ron shook his letter
open and read furiously: "'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have
parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be
impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as
Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret,
therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements.
With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Weasley.'"
Fuming, Nearly Headless Ron stuffed the letter away.
"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Ron! Most people
would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir
Properly Decapitated-Weasley."
Nearly Headless Ron took several deep breaths and then said, in a far
calmer tone, "So - what's bothering you? Anything I can do?"
"No," said Ron. "Not unless you know where we can get seven free
Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -"
The rest of Ron's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling
from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing
into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat
who was used by the caretaker, Ron Weasley, as a sort of deputy in his
endless battle against students.
"You'd better get out of here, Ron," said Ron quickly. "Weasley isn't in a
107
good mood - he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog
brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He's been cleaning all morning,
and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -"
.125
"Right," said Ron, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris,
but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that
seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Ron Weasley burst suddenly through
a tapestry to Ron's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker.
There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose
was unusually purple.
"Filth!" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he
pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Ron's Quidditch robes.
"Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me,
Weasley!"
So Ron waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Ron and followed
Weasley back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the
floor.
Ron had never been inside Weasley's office before; it was a place most
students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil
lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about
the place. Weasleyen filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels,
Ron could see that they contained details of every pupil Weasley had ever
punished. Ron and Ron Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A
highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind
Weasley's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging
Weasley to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.
Weasley grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around
looking for parchment.
"Dung," he muttered furiously, "great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains
. . . rat intestines . . . I've had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where's
the form . . . yes . . ."
.126
He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it
out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.
"Name . . . Ron Weasley. Crime . . ."
"It was only a bit of mud!" said Ron.
"It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!"
shouted Weasley, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose.
"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . ."
Dabbing at his streaming nose, Weasley squinted unpleasantly at Ron who
108
waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.
But as Weasley lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of
the office, which made the oil lamp rattle.
"Ron!" Weasley roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. "I'll
have you this time, I'll have you!"
And without a backward glance at Ron, Weasley ran flat-footed from the
office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.
Ron was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to
cause havoc and distress. Ron didn't much like Ron, but couldn't help
feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Ron had done (and it
sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would
distract Weasley from Ron.
Thinking that he should probably wait for Weasley to come back, Ron sank
into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart
from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver
lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Weasley
wasn't on his way back, Ron picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A
Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic.
127
Intrigued, Ron flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of
parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out
of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to
perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There
is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn
course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell
method! Ron Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: "I had no memory for
incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell
course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of
my Scintillation Solution!" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: "My wife
used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous
Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you,
Kwikspell!"
Fascinated, Ron thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why
on earth did Weasley want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn't a
proper wizard? Ron was just reading "Lesson One: Holding Your Wand
(Some Useful Tips)" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Weasley was
coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Ron threw it
back onto the desk just as the door opened.
Weasley was looking triumphant.
"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!" he was saying gleefully to
Mrs. Norris. "We'll have Ron out this time, my sweet -"
109
His eyes fell on Ron and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which,
Ron realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.
Weasley's pasty face went brick red. Ron braced himself for a tidal wave of
fury. Weasley hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it
into a drawer.
"Have you - did you read -?" he sputtered.
.128
"No," Ron lied quickly.
Weasley's knobbly hands were twisting together.
"If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be that
as it may - however -"
Ron was staring at him, alarmed; Weasley had never looked madder. His eyes
were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan
scarf didn't help.
"Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't
read - go now, I have to write up Ron' report - go -"
Amazed at his luck, Ron sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back
upstairs. To escape from Weasley's office without punishment was probably
some kind of school record.
"Ron! Ron! Did it work?"
Nearly Headless Ron came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Ron
could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to
have been dropped from a great height.
"I persuaded Ron to crash it right over Weasley's office," said Ron eagerly.
"Thought it might distract him -"
"Was that you?" said Ron gratefully. "Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get
detention. Thanks, Ron!"
They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Ron, Ron noticed,
was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter..
129
"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,"
Ron said.
Nearly Headless Ron stopped in his tracks and Ron walked right through
him. He wished he hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower.
"But there is something you could do for me," said Ron excitedly. "Ron -
would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -"
"What is it?" said Ron.
"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday," said Nearly
Headless Ron, drawing himself up and looking dignified.
"Oh," said Ron, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this.
110
"Right."
"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be
coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would
attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Weasley would be most welcome, too, of
course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?" He watched Ron
on tenterhooks.
"No," said Ron quickly, "I'll come -"
"My dear boy! Ron Weasley, at my deathday party! And" - he hesitated,
looking excited - "do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick
how very frightening and impressive you find me?"
"Of - of course," said Ron.
Nearly Headless Ron beamed at him. "A deathday party?" said Ron
keenly when Ron had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the
common room. "I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've
been to one of those - it'll be fascinating!".
130
"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?" said Ron, who
was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. "Sounds dead
depressing to me. . . ."
Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside
all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless
squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in
the case of Ron and Ron Weasley, trying to find out what would happen
if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Ron had "rescued" the
brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class
and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of
curious people.
Ron was at the point of telling Ron and Ron about Weasley and the
Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air,
emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The
sight of Ron bellowing himself hoarse at Ron and Ron, the spectacular
display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its
escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Weasley and the
Kwikspell envelope from Ron's mind. By the time Halloween arrived,
Ron was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of
the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had
been decorated with the usual live bats, Weasley's vast pumpkins had been
carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were
rumors that Weasley had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the
entertainment.
"A promise is a promise," Ron reminded Ron bossily. "You said
111
you'd go to the deathday party."
So at seven o'clock, Ron, Ron, and Ron walked straight past the
doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold
plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.
.131
The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Ron's party had been lined
with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long,
thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light
even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step
they took. As Ron shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he
heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous
blackboard.
"Is that supposed to be music?" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and
saw Nearly Headless Ron standing at a doorway hung with black velvet
drapes.
"My dear friends," he said mournfully. "Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased
you could come. . . ."
He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.
It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white,
translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor,
waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by
an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead
blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose
in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.
"Shall we have a look around?" Ron suggested, wanting to warm up his
feet.
"Careful not to walk through anyone," said Ron nervously, and they set off
around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a
ragged man wearing chains, and the Ron Weasley, a cheerful Weasley ghost,
who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Ron
wasn't surprised to see that the Ron Weasley, a gaunt, staring Weasley
ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the
other ghosts.
.132
"Oh, no," said Ron, stopping abruptly. "Turn back, turn back, I don't
want to talk to Moaning Ron -"
"Who?" said Ron as they backtracked quickly.
"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor," said
Ron.
"She haunts a toilet?"
112
"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and
flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful
trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -"
"Look, food!" said Ron.
On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black
velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their
tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid
on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on
salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry
green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a
tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-
Porpington
died 31st October, 1492
Ron watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched
low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through
one of the stinking salmon.
"Can you taste it if you walk though it?" Ron asked him.
"Almost," said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.
.133
"I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor," said Ron
knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid
haggis.
"Can we move? I feel sick," said Ron.
They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped
suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.
"Hello, Ron," said Ron cautiously.
Unlike the ghosts around them, Ron the Poltergeist was the very reverse
of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a
revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.
"Nibbles?" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in
fungus.
"No thanks," said Ron.
"Heard you talking about poor Ron," said Ron, his eyes dancing.
"Rude you was about poor Ron." He took a deep breath and bellowed,
"OY! Ron!"
"Oh, no, Ron, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset," Ron
whispered frantically. "I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Ron."
The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Ron
had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.
"What?" she said sulkily.
"How are you, Ron?" said Ron in a falsely bright voice. "It's nice to
113
see you out of the toilet."
.134
Ron sniffed.
"Miss Weasley was just talking about you -" said Ron slyly in Ron's
ear.
"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight," said Ron, glaring
at Ron.
Ron eyed Ron suspiciously.
"You're making fun of me," she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her
small, see-through eyes.
"No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Ron's looking?" said
Ron, nudging Ron and Ron painfully in the ribs.
"Oh, yeah -"
"She did -"
"Don't lie to me," Ron gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while
Ron chuckled happily over her shoulder. "D'you think I don't know what
people call me behind my back? Ron Ron! Ugly Ron! Miserable,
moaning, moping Ron!"
"You've forgotten pimply," Ron hissed in her ear.
Moaning Ron burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.
Ron shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, "Pimply!
Pimply!"
"Oh, dear," said Ron sadly.
Nearly Headless Ron now drifted toward them through the crowd.
.135
"Enjoying yourselves?"
"Oh, yes," they lied.
"Not a bad turnout," said Nearly Headless Ron proudly. "The Wailing
Widow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It's nearly time for my speech,
I'd better go and warn the orchestra. . . ."
The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and
everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a
hunting horn sounded.
"Oh, here we go," said Nearly Headless Ron bitterly.
Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a
headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Ron started to clap, too,
but stopped quickly at the sight of Ron's face.
The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing
and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his
bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn.
114
The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the
crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Ron,
squashing his head back onto his neck.
"Ron!" he roared. "How are you? Head still hanging in there?"
He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Ron on the shoulder.
"Welcome, Patrick," said Ron stiffly.
"Live 'uns!" said Sir Patrick, spotting Ron, Ron, and Ron and giving
a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd
howled with laughter).
.136
"Very amusing," said Nearly Headless Ron darkly.
"Don't mind Ron!" shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. "Still upset we
won't let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -"
"I think," said Ron hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Ron, "Ron's very
- frightening and - er -"
"Ha!" yelled Sir Patrick's head. "Bet he asked you to say that!"
"If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!" said Nearly
Headless Ron loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy
blue spotlight.
"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . ."
But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt
had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to
watch. Nearly Headless Ron tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave
up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers.
Ron was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.
"I can't stand much more of this," Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the
orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance
floor.
"Let's go," Ron agreed.
They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked
at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of
black candles.
"Pudding might not be finished yet," said Ron hopefully, leading the way
toward the steps to the entrance hall.
.137
And then Ron heard it.
". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . ."
It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in
Weasley's office.
He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his
115
might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.
"Ron, what're you -?"
"It's that voice again - shut up a minute -"
". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . ."
"Listen!" said Ron urgently, and Ron and Ron froze, watching him.
". . . kill . . . time to kill . . ."
The voice was growing fainter. Ron was sure it was moving away -
moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared
at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to
whom stone ceilings didn't matter?
"This way," he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance
hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the
Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Ron sprinted up the
marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Ron clattering behind him.
"Ron, what're we -"
"SHH!"
.138
Ron strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter
still, he heard the voice: ". . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!"
His stomach lurched -
"It's going to kill someone!" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Ron's
bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to
listen over his own pounding footsteps -
Ron hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Ron
panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last,
deserted passage.
"Ron, what was that all about?" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. "I
couldn't hear anything. . . ."
But Ron gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.
"Look!"
Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly,
squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the
wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming
torches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir,
beware.
"What's that thing - hanging underneath?" said Ron, a slight quiver in his
voice.
As they edged nearer, Ron almost slipped - there was a large puddle of
water on the floor; Ron and Ron grabbed him, and they inched toward
the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them
realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash..Mrs. Norris,
116
the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch
bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.
For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, "Let's get out of here."
"Shouldn't we try and help -" Ron began awkwardly.
"Trust me," said Ron. "We don't want to be found here."
But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that
the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood
came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy
talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the
passage from both ends.
The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted
the hanging cat. Ron, Ron, and Ron stood alone, in the middle of the
corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see
the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
It was Ron Weasley. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.
C H A P T X IR N I N E
THE WRTITING
ON THE WALL
What's going on here? What's going on?" Attracted no doubt by
Weasley's shout, Ron Weasley came shouldering his way through the
crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in
horror.
"My cat! My cat! What's happened to Mrs. Norris?" he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Ron.
"You!"he screeched. "You! You've murdered my cat! You've
killed her! I'll kill you! I'll -"
"Ron!"
Weasley had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
117
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Ron, Ron, and Ron
and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.
"Come with me, Ron," he said to Weasley. "You, too, Mr. Weasley, Mr.
Weasley, Miss Weasley."
Weasley stepped forward eagerly.
*140*
"My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -"
"Thank you, Ron," said Weasley.
The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Weasley, looking excited and
important, hurried after Weasley; so did Professors Weasley
and Weasley.
As they entered Weasley's darkened office there was a flurry of
movement across the walls; Ron saw several of the Weasleys in the
pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Weasley lit
the candles on his desk and stood back. Weasley lay Mrs. Norris
on the polished surface and began to examine her. Ron, Ron, and
Ron exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool
of candlelight, watching.
The tip of Weasley's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from
Mrs. Norris's fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon
spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor
Weasley was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Weasley
loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar
expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And
Weasley was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.
"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian
Torture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I
know the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....
Weasley's comments were punctuated by Weasley's dry, racking sobs.
He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris,
118
his face in his hands. Much as he detested Weasley, Ron
*141*
couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as
he felt for himself If Weasley believed Weasley, he would be expelled
for sure.
Weasley was now muttering strange words under his breath and
tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She
continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.
". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,"
said Weasley, "a series of attacks, the full story's in my
autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various
amulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......
The photographs of Weasley on the walls were all nodding in
agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair
net.
At last Weasley straightened up.
"She's not dead, Ron," he said softly.
Weasley stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of
murders he had prevented.
"Not dead?" choked Weasley, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris.
"But why's she all - all stiff and frozen?"
"She has been Petrified," said Weasley ("Ah! I thought so!" said
Weasley). "But how, I cannot say . . . ."
"Ask him!" shrieked Weasley, turning his blotched and tearstained face to
Ron.
"No second year could have done this," said Weasley firmly. "it
would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -"
"He did it, he did it!" Weasley spat, his pouchy face purpling. "You saw
what he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I'm a -
119
I'm a -" Weasley's face worked horribly. "He knows I'm a Squib!" he
finished.
142
"I never touched Mrs. Norris!" Ron said loudly, uncomfortably
aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Weasleys on the
walls. "And I don't even know what a Squib is."
"Rubbish!" snarled Weasley. "He saw my Kwikspell letter!"
"If I might speak, Headmaster," said Weasley from the shadows, and
Ron's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Weasley had
to say was going to do him any good.
"Weasley and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the
wrong time," he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he
doubted it. "But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.
Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at the
Halloween feast?"
Ron, Ron and Ron all launched into an explanation about the
deathday party. ". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were
there -"
"But why not join the feast afterward?" said Weasley, his black eyes
glittering in the candlelight. "Why go up to that corridor?"
Ron and Ron looked at Ron.
"Because - because -" Ron said, his heart thumping very fast;
something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he
had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,
"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed," he said.
"Without any supper?" said Weasley, a triumphant smile flickering across
his gaunt face. "I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people
at their parties."
"We weren't hungry," said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge
rumble.
120
Weasley's nasty smile widened.
*143*
"I suggest, Headmaster, that Weasley is not being entirely truthful," he
said. "It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges
until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should
be taken off the Weasley Quidditch team until he is ready to be
honest."
"Really, Ron," said Professor Weasley sharply, "I see no
reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over the
head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Weasley has
done anything wrong."
Weasley was giving Ron a searching look. His twinkling lightblue
gaze made Ron feel as though he were being X-rayed.
"Innocent until proven guilty, Ron," he said firmly.
Weasley looked furious. So did Weasley.
"My cat has been Petrified!" he shrieked, his eyes popping. "I want to
see some punishment!"
"We will be able to cure her, Ron," said Weasley patiently.
"Professer Weasley recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As
soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that
will revive Mrs. Norris."
"I'll make it," Weasley butted in. "I must have done it a hundred times.
I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -"
"Excuse me," said Weasley icily. "But I believe I am the Potions master
at this school."
There was a very awkward pause.
"You may go," Weasley said to Ron, Ron, and Ron.
They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When
they were a floor up from Weasley's office, they turned into
121
*144*
an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Ron
squinted at his friends' darkened faces.
"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?"
"No," said Ron, without hesitation. "Hearing voices no one else can
hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world."
Something in Ron's voice made Ron ask, "You do believe me, don't
you?"
"'Course I do," said Ron quickly. "But -you must admit it's weird ......
"I know it's weird," said Ron. "The whole thing's weird. What was
that writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened...
What's that supposed to mean?"
"You know, it rings a sort of bell," said Ron slowly. "I think someone
told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've
been Ron . . . ."
"And what on earth's a Squib?" said Ron.
To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.
"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Weasley, he said. "A Squib is
someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any
magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but
Squibs are quite unusual. If Weasley's trying to learn magic from a
Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot.
Like why he hates students so much." Ron gave a satisfied smile.
"He's bitter."
A clock chimed somewhere.
"Midnight," said Ron. "We'd better get to bed before Weasley comes
along and tries to frame us for something else."
*145*
122
For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on
Mrs. Norris. Weasley kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot
where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might
come back. Ron had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall
with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no
effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When
Weasley wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyed
through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and
trying to put them in detention for things like "breathing loudly' and
"looking happy."
Ron Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate.
According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.
"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris," Ron told her
bracingly. "Honestly, we're much better off without her." Ron's lip
trembled. "Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts," Ron
assured her. "They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of
here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Weasley before he's
expelled. I'm only joking -" Ron added hastily as Ron blanched.
The attack had also had an effect on Ron. It was quite usual for
Ron to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing
almost nothing else. Nor could Ron and Ron get much response
from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the
following Wednesday did they find out.
Ron had been held back in Potions, where Weasley had made him stay
behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he
went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Ron Finch-
Fletchley, the Weasley boy from Herbology, coming
*146*
toward him. Ron had just opened his mouth to say hello when Ron
caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite
direction.
Ron found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of
123
Magic homework. Professor Weasley had asked for a threefoot-long
composition on "The Medieval Assembly of European
Wizards."
"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short said Ron fu
riously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll.
"And Ron's done four feet seven inches and her writing's
tiny. "
"Where is she?" asked Ron, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling
his own homework.
"Somewhere over there," said Ron, pointing along the shelves. "Looking
for another book. I think she's trying to read the whole library before
Christmas."
Ron told Ron about Ron Weasley running away from him.
"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot," said Ron,
scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. "All that junk
about Weasley being so great -"
Ron emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable
and at last seemed ready to talk to them.
"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out," she said,
sitting down next to Ron and Ron. "And there's a two-week waiting
list. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk
with all the Weasley books."
"Why do you want it?" said Ron.
*141*
"The same reason everyone else wants it," said Ron, "to read
up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets."
"What's that?" said Ron quickly.
"That's just it. I can't remember," said Ron, biting her lip. "And
I can't find the story anywhere else -"
124
"Ron, let me read your composition," said Ron desperately,
checking his watch.
"No, I won't," said Ron, suddenly severe. "You've had ten
days to finish it -"
"I only need another two inches, come on -"
The bell rang. Ron and Ron led the way to History of Magic,
bickering.
History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor
Weasley, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most
exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the
room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people
said he hadn't noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach
one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the
staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.
Today was as boring as ever. Professor Weasley opened his notes and
began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly
everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to
long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again.
He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened
that had never happened before. Ron put up her hand.
Professor Weasley, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec
*148*
ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.
"Miss - er -?"
"Weasley, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything
about the Chamber of Secrets," said Ron in a clear voice.
Ron Ron, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open,
gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Ron Weasley's
head came up off her arms and Ron Weasley's elbow slipped
off his desk.
125
Professor Weasley blinked.
"My subject is History of Magic," he said in his dry, wheezy voice. "I
deal with facts, Miss Weasley, not myths and legends." He cleared his
throat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, "In
September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers
"
He stuttered to a halt. Ron's hand was waving in the air again.
"Miss Grant?"
"Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?"
Professor Weasley was looking at her in such amazement, Ron was
sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.
"Well," said Professor Weasley slowly, "yes, one could argue that, I
suppose." He peered at Ron as though he had never seen a
student properly before. "However, the legend of which you speak is
such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -"
But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Weasley's every
word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Ron
*149*
could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of
interest.
"Oh, very well," he said slowly. "Let me see ... the Chamber of
Secrets ...
"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand
years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after
them: Ron Weasley, Ron Weasley, Ron Weasley, and
Ron Weasley. They built this castle together, far from prying
Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common
people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution."
126
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.
"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking
out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the
castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between
them. A rift began to grow between Weasley and the others. Weasley
wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He
believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.
He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be
untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the
subject between Weasley and Weasley, and Weasley left the
school."
Professor Weasley paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled
old tortoise.
"Reliable historical sources tell us this much," he said. "But these
honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the
Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Weasley had built a
*150*
hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew
nothing.
"Weasley, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets
so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at
the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of
Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of
all who were unworthy to study magic."
There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn't the
usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Weasley's classes. There was
unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for
more. Professor Weasley looked faintly annoyed.
"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course," he said. "Naturally,
the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many
times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A
tale told to frighten the gullible."
127
Ron's hand was back in the air.
"Sir - what exactly do you mean by the `horror within' the
Chamber?"
"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of
Weasley alone can control," said Professor Weasley in his dry, reedy
voice.
The class exchanged nervous looks.
"I tell you, the thing does not exist," said Professor Weasley, shuffling his
notes. "There is no Chamber and no monster."
"But, sir," said Ron Weasley, "if the Chamber can only be opened
by Weasley's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would
they?"
"Nonsense, O'Flaherty," said Professor Weasley in an aggravated
*151*
tone. "If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and
headmistresses haven't found the thing -"
"But, Professor," piped up Ron Weasley, "you'd probably have to use
Dark Magic to open it -"
"Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic doesn't mean he
can't, Miss Pennyfeather," snapped Professor Weasley. "I repeat, if the
likes of Weasley -"
"But maybe you've got to be related to Weasley, so Weasley
couldn't -" began Ron Ron, but Professor Weasley had had
enough.
"That will do," he said sharply. "It is a myth! It does not exist! There
is not a shred of evidence that Weasley ever built so much as a
secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We
will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable
fact!"
128
And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.
"I always knew Ron Weasley was a twisted old loony," Ron told
Ron and Ron as they fought their way through the teeming
corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before
dinner. "But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I
wouldn't be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat
had tried to put me in Weasley, I'd've got the train straight back
home ......
Ron nodded fervently, but Ron didn't say anything. His
stomach had just dropped unpleasantly.
Ron had never told Ron and Ron that the Sorting Hat
*152*
had seriously considered putting him in Weasley. He could remember,
as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear
when he'd placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great,
you know, it's all here in your head, and Weasley would help you on the
way to greatness, no doubt about that...
But Ron, who had already heard of Weasley House's reputa
tion for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not
Weasley! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you're sure ... better be
Weasley...
As they were shunted along in the throng, Ron Creevy went past.
"Hiya, Ron!"
"Hullo, Ron," said Ron automatically.
"Ron - Ron - a boy in my class has been saying you're
But Ron was so small he couldn~t fight against the tide of people
bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, "See you,
Ron!" and he was gone.
"What's a boy in his class saying about you?" Ron wondered.
129
"That I'm Weasley's heir, I expect," said Ron, his stomach dropping
another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Ron Finch-
Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime.
"People here'll believe anything," said Ron in disgust.
The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase
without difficulty.
"D'you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets?" Ron asked
Ron.
"I don't know," she said, frowning. "Weasley couldn't cure
* 1,5 % *
Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her
might not be - well - human."
As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end
of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped
and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that
there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty
chair stood against the wall bearing the message "The Chamber of
Secrets has been Opened."
"That's where Weasley has been keeping guard," Ron muttered.
They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.
"Can't hurt to have a poke around," said Ron, dropping his bag and
getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching
for clues.
"Scorch marks!" he said. "Here - and here -"
"Come and look at this!" said Ron. "This is funny . . . ."
Ron got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the
wall. Ron was pointing at the topmost pane, where around
twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a
130
small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though
they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.
"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?" said Ron
wonderingly.
"No," said Ron, "have you, Ron? Ron?"
He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed
to be fighting the impulse to run.
"What's up?" said Ron.
"I - don't - like - spiders," said Ron tensely.
"I never knew that," said Ron, looking at Ron in surprise.
"You've used spiders in Potions loads of times ......
*154*
"I don't mind them dead," said Ron, who was carefully looking
anywhere but at the window. "I just don't like the way they move ....
Ron giggled.
"It's not funny," said Ron, fiercely. "If you must know, when I was
three, Ron turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider
because I broke his toy broomstick .... You wouldn't like them either if
you'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and. .
. "
He broke off, shuddering. Ron was obviously still trying not to
laugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Ron said,
"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from?
Someone's mopped it up."
"It was about here," said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces
past Weasley's chair and pointing. "Level with this door."
He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as
though he'd been burned.
131
"What's the matter?" said Ron.
"Can't go in there," said Ron gruffly. "That's a girls' toilet."
"Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there," said Ron, standing up
and coming over. "That's Moaning Ron's place. Come on, let's have
a look."
And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door.
It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Ron had ever set
foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of
chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given
off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the
wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of
them was dangling off its hinges.
* -L 5,5
Ron put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall.
When she reached it she said, "Hello, Ron, how are you?"
Ron and Ron went to look. Moaning Ron was floating above the
tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.
"This is a girls' bathroom," she said, eyeing Ron and Ron suspiciously.
"They're not girls."
"No," Ron agreed. "I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is
in here."
She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.
"Ask her if she saw anything," Ron mouthed at Ron.
"What are you whispering?" said Ron, staring at him.
"Nothing," said Ron quickly. "We wanted to ask -"
"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!" said Ron, in a
voice choked with tears. "I do have feelings, you know, even if I am
dead -"
132
"Ron, no one wants to upset you," said Ron. "Ron only -"
"No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!" howled Ron. "My
life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along
ruining my death!"
"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately," said
Ron quickly. "Because a cat was attacked right outside your
front door on Halloween."
"Did you see anyone near here that night?" said Ron.
"I wasn't paying attention," said Ron dramatically. "Ron upset me
so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I
remembered that I'm - that I'm "
"Already dead," said Ron helpfully.
* IL 56*
Ron gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived
headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing
from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had
come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.
Ron and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Ron shrugged
wearily and said, "Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Ron ....
Come on, let's go."
Ron had barely closed the door on Ron's gurgling sobs when a
loud voice made all three of them jump.
"RON!"
Ron Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect
badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.
"That's a girls' bathroom!" he gasped. "What were you -?"
"Just having a look around," Ron shrugged. "Clues, you know -"
133
Ron swelled in a manner that reminded Ron forcefully of Mrs.
Weasley.
"Get - away - from - there -" Perry said, striding toward them and
starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. "Don't you care what
this looks like? Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -"
"Why shouldn't we be here?" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring
at Ron. "Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!"
"That's what I told Ron," said Ron fiercely, "but she still seems to
think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying
her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly
overexcited by this business -"
"You don't care about Ron," said Ron, whose ears were now
*157*
reddening. "You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of
being Head Boy -"
"Five points from Weasley!" Ron said tersely, fingering his prefect
badge. "And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or
I'll write to Mum!"
And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears.
Ron, Ron, and Ron chose seats as far as possible from Ron
in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and
kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his
wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost
as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Rondard Book of Spells,
Grade 2 shut. To Ron's surprise, Ron followed suit.
"Who can it be, though?" she said in a quiet voice, as though
continuing a conversation they had just been having. "Who'd want to
frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?"
"Let's think," said Ron in mock puzzlement. "Who do we know who
thinks Muggle-borns are scum?"
134
He looked at Ron. Ron looked back, unconvinced.
"If you're talking about Weasley -"
"Of course I am!" said Ron. "You heard him - `You'll be next,
Mudbloods!'- come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face to
know it's him -"
"Weasley, the Heir of Weasley?" said Ron skeptically.
"Look at his family," said Ron, closing his books, too. "The whole lot
of them have been in Weasley; he's always boasting about it. They
could easily be Weasley's descendants. His father's definitely evil
enough."
*158*
"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!"
said Ron. "Handing it down, father to son ......
"Well," said Ron cautiously, "I suppose it's possible ......
"But how do we prove it?" said Ron darkly.
"There might be a way," said Ron slowly, dropping her voice still
further with a quick glance across the room at Ron. "Of course, it
would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We'd be breaking
about fifty school rules, I expect -"
"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know,
won't you?" said Ron irritably.
"All right," said Ron coldly. "What we'd need to do is to get
inside the Weasley common room and ask Weasley a few questions
without him realizing it's us."
"But that's impossible," Ron said as Ron laughed.
"No, it's not," said Ron. "All we'd need would be some Polyjuice
Potion."
"What's that?" said Ron and Ron together.
135
"Weasley mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -"
"D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Weasley?" muttered Ron.
"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could
change into three of the Weasleys. No one would know it was us.
Weasley would probably tell us anything. He's probably boasting about it
in the Weasley common room right now, if only we could hear him."
"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me," said Ron, frowning.
"What if we were stuck looking like three of the Weasleys forever?"
"It wears off after a while," said Ron, waving her hand
*159*
impatiently. "But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult.
Weasley said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's
bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library."
There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted
Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.
"Hard to see why we'd want the book, really," said Ron, "if we
weren't going to try and make one of the potions."
"I think," said Ron, "that if we made it sound as though
we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ......
"Oh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that," said Ron.
"They'd have to be really thick . . . ."
C H-H A P T V It T 1' N
THE ROGUE BLUDGER
ince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Weasley had not
brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his
books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic
bits. He usually picked Ron to help him with these reconstructions;
so far, Ron had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager
whom Weasley had cured of a Weasley Curse, a yeti with a head
cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except
lettuce since Weasley had dealt with him.
136
Ron was hauled to the front of the class during their very next
Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf If
he hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Weasley in a good
mood, he would have refused to do it.
"Nice loud howl, Ron - exactly - and then, if you'll believe it, I
pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I
managed to hold him down - with my other, I
*161*
put my wand to his throat -I then screwed up my remaining strength
and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let
out a piteous moan - go on, Ron - higher than that - good - the fur
vanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple,
yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the
hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf
attacks."
The bell rang and Weasley got to his feet.
"Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga
Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the
best one!"
The class began to leave. Ron returned to the back of the room,
where Ron and Ron were waiting.
"Ready?" Ron muttered.
"Wait till everyone's gone," said Ron nervously. "All right . . . "
She approached Weasley's desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in
her hand, Ron and Ron right behind her.
"Er - Professor Weasley?" Ron stammered. "I wanted to - to
get this book out of the library. Just for background reading." She
held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. "But the thing
is, it's in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to
137
sign for it - I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in
Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms
"Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!" said Weasley, taking the note from
Ron and smiling widely at her. "Possibly my very favorite
book. You enjoyed it?"
-162
"Oh, yes," said Ron eagerly. "So clever, the way you trapped that
last one with the tea-strainer -"
"Well, I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year
a little extra help," said Weasley warmly, and he pulled out an
enormous peacock quill. "Yes, nice, isn't it?" he said, misreading the
revolted look on Ron's face. "I usually save it for book-signings."
He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it
back to Ron.
"So, Ron," said Weasley, while Ron folded the note with
fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. "Ronorrow's the first
Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Weasley against Weasley,
is it not? I hear you're a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was
asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life
to the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need
for a little private training, don't hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass
on my expertise to less able players ......
Ron made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after
Ron and Ron.
"I don't believe it," he said as the three of them examined the signature
on the note. "He didn't even look at the book we wanted."
"That's because he's a brainless git," said Ron. "But who cares, we've
got what we needed -"
"He is not a brainless git," said Ron shrilly as they half ran
toward the library.
"Just because he said you were the best student of the year -"
138
They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the
library. Ron Weasley, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who
looked like an underfed vulture.
*163*
"Moste Potente Potions?" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the
note from Ron; but Ron wouldn't let go.
"I was wondering if I could keep it," she said breathlessly.
"Oh, come on," said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it
at Ron Weasley. "We'll get you another autograph. Weasley'll sign
anything if it stands still long enough."
Ron Weasley held the note up to the light, as though determined to
detect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the
lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and
moldy-looking book. Ron put it carefully into her bag and they
left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.
Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Ron's out-oforder
bathroom once again. Ron had overridden Ron's objections
by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds
would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Ron
was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she
them.
Ron opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of
them bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance
why it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had
effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very
unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have
been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of
arms out of her head.
"Here it is," said Ron excitedly as she found the page headed The
Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway
through transforming into other people. Ron sin
*164*
139
cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their
faces.
"This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen," said Ron as
they scanned the recipe. "Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and
knotgrass," she murmured, running her finger down the list of
ingredients. "Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student storecupboard,
we can help ourselves .... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a
bicorn - don't know where we're going to get that - shredded skin of a
boomslang -. that'll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we
want to change into."
"Excuse me?" said Ron sharply. "What d'you mean, a bit of whoever
we're changing into? I'm drinking nothing with Weasley's toenails in it -"
Ron continued as though she hadn't heard him.
"We don't have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those
bits last ......
Ron turned, speechless, to Ron, who had another worry.
"D'you realize how much we're going to have to steal, Ron?
Shredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students'
cupboard. What're we going to do, break into Weasley's private stores? I
don't know if this is a good idea ......
Ron shut the book with a snap.
"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine," she said. There were
bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than
usual. "I don't want to break rules, you know. I think threatening
Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if
you don't want to find out if it's Weasley, I'll go straight to Ron Weasley
now and hand the book back in ='
*165
"I never thought Id see the day when you'd be persuading us to
break rules," said Ron. "All right, we'll do it. But not toenails, okay?"
140
"How long will it take to make, anyway?" said Ron as Ron,
looking happier, opened the book again.
"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and
the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I'd say
it'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients."
"A month?" said Ron. "Weasley could have attacked half the Muggleborns
in the school by then!" But Ron's eyes narrowed
dangerously again, and he added swiftly, "But it's the best plan we've
got, so full steam ahead, I say."
However, while Ron was checking that the coast was clear for
them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Ron, "It'll be a lot less
hassle if you can just knock Weasley off his broom tomorrow.
Ron woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking
about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the
thought of what Weasley would say if Weasley lost, but also at the
idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold
could buy. He had never wanted to beat Weasley so badly. After
half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up,
dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest
of the Weasley team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking
uptight and not speaking much.
As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make its
way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day
*166*
with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Ron came hurrying
over to wish Ron good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The
team pulled on their scarlet Weasley robes, then sat down to listen to
Weasley's usual pre-match pep talk.
"Weasley has better brooms than us," he began. "No point denying it.
But we've got better people on our brooms. We've trained harder than
they have, we've been flying in all weathers -" ("Too true," muttered
Ron Weasley. "I haven't been properly dry since August") "- and
we're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime,
Weasley, buy his way onto their team."
141
Chest heaving with emotion, Weasley turned to Ron.
"It'll be down to you, Ron, to show them that a Seeker has to have
something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Weasley or
die trying, Ron, because we've got to win today, we've got to."
"So no pressure, Ron" said Ron, winking at him.
As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly
cheers, because Weasley and Weasley were anxious to see
Weasley beaten, but the Weasleys in the crowd made their boos and
hisses heard, too. Ron Weasley, the Quidditch teacher, asked Weasley
and Weasley to shake hands, which they did, giving each other
threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.
"On my whistle," said Ron Weasley. "Three ... two ... one. . .
With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen
players rose toward the leaden sky. Ron flew higher than any of
them, squinting around for the Snitch.
*167*
"All right there, Scarhead?" yelled Weasley, shooting underneath him as
though to show off the speed of his broom.
Ron had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black
Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he
felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.
"Close one, Ron!" said Ron, streaking past him with his club in his
hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Weasley. Ron saw
Ron give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian
Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight
for Ron again.
Ron dropped quickly to avoid it, and Ron managed to hit it hard
toward Weasley. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang
and shot at Ron's head.
Ron put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the
142
pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What
was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it
was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible ....
Ron Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Ron
ducked as Ron swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger
was knocked off course.
"Gotcha!" Ron yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was
magnetically attracted to Ron, the Bludger pelted after him once
more and Ron was forced to fly off at full speed.
It had started to rain; Ron felt heavy drops fall onto his face,
splattering onto his glasses. He didn't have a clue what was going on
in the rest of the game until he heard Ron Weasley, who was
commentating, say, "Weasley lead, sixty points to zero ='
*168*
The Weasleys' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and
meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Ron
out of the air. Ron and Ron were now flying so close to him on
either side that Ron could see nothing at all except their flailing arms
and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.
"Someone's - tampered - with - this - Bludger -" Ron grunted,
swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on
Ron.
"We need time out," said Ron, trying to signal to Weasley and stop
the Bludger breaking Ron's nose at the same time.
Weasley had obviously got the message. Ron Weasley's whistle rang
out and Ron, Ron, and Ron dived for the ground, still trying to
avoid the mad Bludger.
"What's going on?" said Weasley as the Weasley team huddled
together, while Weasleys in the crowd jeered. "We're being
flattened. Ron, Ron, where were you when that Bludger stopped
Ron scoring?"
"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from
143
murdering Ron, Ron," said Ron angrily. "Someone's fixed it -
it won't leave Ron alone. It hasn't gone for anyone else all game.
The Weasleys must have done something to it."
"But the Bludgers have been locked in Ron Weasley's office since
our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . . "
said Weasley, anxiously.
Ron Weasley was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Ron
could see the Weasley team jeering and pointing in his direction.
169
"Listen," said Ron as she came nearer and nearer, "with you two
flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the
Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and
let me deal with the rogue one."
"Don't be thick," said Ron. "It'll take your head off."
Weasley was looking from Ron to the Weasleys.
(I Ron, this is insane," said Ron Spinner angrily. "You can't let Ron
deal with that thing on his own. Let's ask for an inquiry -))
"If we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match!" said Ron. "And
we're not losing to Weasley just because of a crazy Bludger! Come
on, Ron, tell them to leave me alone!"
"This is all your fault," Ron said angrily to Weasley. " `Get the Snitch
or die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell him -"
Ron Weasley had joined them.
"Ready to resume play?" she asked Weasley.
Weasley looked at the determined look on Ron's face.
"All right," he said. "Ron, Ron, you heard Ron -leave him alone
and let him deal with the Bludger on his own."
The rain was falling more heavily now. On Ron Weasley's whistle,
144
Ron kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the
Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Ron climbed; he looped and
swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless
kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his
nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the
Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must
look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change
direction as quickly as Ron could; he began a kind of roller-coaster
ride around the
*170*
edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the
Weasley goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past
Weasley
A whistling in Ron's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him
again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.
"Training for the ballet, Weasley?" yelled Weasley as Ron was forced to
do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the
Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at
Weasley in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches
above Weasley's left ear - and Weasley, busy laughing at Ron, hadn't
seen it.
For an agonizing moment, Ron hung in midair, not daring to speed
toward Weasley in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.
WHAM.
He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last,
smashed into his elbow, and Ron felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by
the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched
broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at
his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time
W-ming at his face - Ron swerved out of the way, one idea firmly
lodged in his numb brain: get to Weasley.
Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering
face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Weasley thought
Ron was attacking him.
145
"What the -" he gasped, careening out of Ron's way.
Ron took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch;
he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only
*171*
gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd
below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass
out.
With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His
arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard,
as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He
focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.
"Aha," he said vaguely. "We've won."
And he fainted.
He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with
someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.
"Oh, no, not you," he moaned.
"Doesn't know what he's saying," said Weasley loudly to the anxious
crowd of Weasleys pressing around them. "Not to worry, Ron.
I'm about to fix your arm."
"No!"said Ron. "I'll keep it like this, thanks ......
He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar
clicking noise nearby.
"I don't want a photo of this, Ron," he said loudly.
"Lie back, Ron," said Weasley soothingly. "It's a simple charm I've
used countless times -"
"Why can't I just go to the hospital wing?" said Ron through
clenched teeth.
146
"He should really, Professor," said a muddy Weasley, who couldn't
help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. "Great capture,
Ron, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -"
Through the thicket of legs around him, Ron spotted Ron and
*112*
Ron Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still
putting up a terrific fight.
"Rond back," said Weasley, who was rolling up his jade-green
sleeves.
"No - don't -" said Ron weakly, but Weasley was twirling his wand
and a second later had directed it straight at Ron's arm.
A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Ron's shoulder and
spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was
being deflated. He didn't dare look at what was happening. He had
shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears
were realized as the people above him gasped and Ron Weasley
began clicking away madly. His arm didn't hurt anymore - nor did it
feel remotely like an arm.
"Ah," said Weasley. "Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the
point is, the bones are no longer broken. That's the thing to bear in
mind. So, Ron, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley,
Miss Weasley, would you escort him? - and Ron Weasley will be
able to - er - tidy you up a bit."
As Ron got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep
breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him
pass out again.
Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, fleshcolored
rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.
Weasley hadn't mended Ron's bones. He had removed them.
Ron Weasley wasn't at all pleased.
147
"You should have come straight to me!" she raged, holding up
*173*
the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a
working arm. "I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back -
"
"You will be able to, won't you?" said Ron desperately.
"I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful," said Ron Weasley
grimly, throwing Ron a pair of pajamas. "You'll have to stay the
night ......
Ron waited outside the curtain drawn around Ron's bed while
Ron helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery,
boneless arm into a sleeve.
"How can you stick up for Weasley now, Ron, eh?" Ron called
through the curtain as he pulled Ron's limp fingers through the cuff.
"If Ron had wanted deboning he would have asked."
"Anyone can make a mistake," said Ron. "And it doesn't hurt
anymore, does it, Ron?"
"No," said Ron, getting into bed. "But it doesn't do anything else
either."
As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.
Ron and Ron Weasley came around the curtain. Ron
Weasley was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.
"You're in for a rough night," she said, pouring out a steaming
beakerful and handing it to him. "Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Ron's mouth and throat as it
went down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about
dangerous sports and inept teachers, Ron Weasley re
*114*
148
treated, leaving Ron and Ron to help Ron gulp down some
water.
"We won, though," said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.
"That was some catch you made. Weasley's face ... he looked ready
to kill ......
"I want to know how he fixed that Bludger," said Ron
darkly.
"We can add that to the list of questions we'll ask him when
we've taken the Polyjuice Potion," said Ron, sinking back onto
his pillows. "I hope it tastes better than this stuff .....
"If it's got bits of Weasleys in it? You've got to be joking," said
Ron.
The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy
and soaking wet, the rest of the Weasley team had arrived to see
Ron.
"Unbelievable flying, Ron," said Ron. "I've just seen Mar
cus Weasley yelling at Weasley. Something about having the Snitch on
top of his head and not noticing. Weasley didn't seem too happy."
They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice;
they gathered around Ron's bed and were just getting started on
what promised to be a good party when Ron Weasley came
storming over, shouting, "This boy needs rest, he's got thirty-three
bones to regrow! Out! OUT!"
And Ron was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the
stabbing pains in his limp arm.
Hours and hours later, Ron woke quite suddenly in the pitch
blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of
large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken
him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was
sponging his forehead in the dark.
"Get off!" he said loudly, and then, "Ron!"
The house-elf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Ron
through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long,
pointed nose.
"Ron Weasley came back to school," he whispered miserably.
149
"Ron warned and warned Ron Weasley. Ah sir, why didn't you
heed Ron? Why didn't Ron Weasley go back home when he
missed the train?"
Ron heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Ron's sponge
away.
"What're you doing here?" he said. "And how did you know I missed
the train?"
Ron's lip trembled and Ron was seized by a sudden suspicion.
"It was you!" he said slowly. "You stopped the barrier from letting us
through!"
"Indeed yes, sir," said Ron, nodding his head vigorously, ears
flapping. "Ron hid and watched for Ron Weasley and sealed the
gateway and Ron had to iron his hands afterward" - he showed
Ron ten long, bandaged fingers - "but Ron didn't care, sir, for he
thought Ron Weasley was safe, and never did Ron dream that Ron
Weasley would get to school another way!"
He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.
"Ron was 'so shocked when he heard Ron Weasley was back at
Hogwarts, he let his master's dinner burn! Such a flogging Ron
never had, sir . .....
*176*
Ron slumped back onto his pillows.
"You nearly got Ron and me expelled," he said fiercely. "You'd better
get lost before my bones come back, Ron, or I might strangle you."
Ron smiled weakly.
"Ron is used to death threats, sir. Ron gets them five times a day
at home."
He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking
so pathetic that Ron felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.
150
"Why d'you wear that thing, Ron?" he asked curiously.
"This, sir?" said Ron, plucking at the pillowcase. "'Tis a mark of the
house-elf's enslavement, sir. Ron can only be freed if his masters
present him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Ron
even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house
forever."
Ron mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, "Ron Weasley must
go home! Ron thought his Bludger would be enough to make -"
"Your Bludger?" said Ron, anger rising once more. "What d'you
mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?"
"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!" said Ron, shocked. "Ron wants
to save Ron Weasley's life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than
remain here sir! Ron only wanted Ron Weasley hurt enough to be
sent home!"
"Oh, is that all?" said Ron angrily. "I don't suppose you're going to
tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?"
"Ah, if Ron Weasley only knew!" Ron groaned, more tears dripping
onto his ragged pillowcase. "If he knew what he means
*177*
to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world!
Ron remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
was at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elfs were treated like
vermin, sir! Of course, Ron is still treated like that, sir," he admitted,
drying his face on the pillowcase. "But mostly, sir, life has improved
for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Ron Weasley survived, and the Dark Lord's power was broken, and it
was a new dawn, sir, and Ron Weasley shone like a beacon of hope
for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... And
now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening
already, and Ron cannot let Ron Weasley stay here now that history
is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more
Ron froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Ron's water jug from his
151
bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A
second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering,
"Bad Ron, very bad Ron. . ."
"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?" Ron whispered. "And did you
say it's been opened before? Tell me, Ron!"
He seized the elf's bony wrist as Ron's hand inched toward the
water jug. "But I'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the
Chamber?"
"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Ron," stammered the elf,
his eyes huge in the dark. "Dark deeds are planned in this place, but
Ron Weasley must not be here when they happen - go home, Ron
Weasley, go home. Ron Weasley must not meddle in this, sir, 'tis too
dangerous -"
"Who is it, Ron?" Ron said, keeping a firm hold on Ron's
*178*
wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. "Who's
opened it? Who opened it last time?"
"Ron can't, sir, Ron can't, Ron mustn't tell!" squealed the elf.
"Go home, Ron Weasley, go home!"
"I'm not going anywhere!" said Ron fiercely. "One of my best
friends is Muggle-born; she'll be first in line if the Chamber really has
been opened -"
"Ron Weasley risks his own life for his friends!" moaned Ron in a
kind of miserable ecstasy. "So noble! So valiant! But he must save
himself, he must, Ron Weasley must not -"
Ron suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Ron heard it, too.
There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.
"Ron must go!" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack,
and Ron's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back
into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the
footsteps drew nearer.
152
Next moment, Weasley was backing into the dormitory, wearing a
long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end
of what looked like a statue. Professor Weasley appeared a
second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.
"Get Ron Weasley," whispered Weasley, and Professor
Weasley hurried past the end of Ron's bed out of sight. Ron lay
quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then
Professor Weasley swept back into view, closely followed by
Ron Weasley, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress.
He heard a sharp intake of breath.
"What happened?" Ron Weasley whispered to Weasley,
bending over the statue on the bed.
*l79*
"Another attack," said Weasley. "Ron found him on the stairs.
"There was a bunch of grapes next to him," said Professor
Weasley. "We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Weasley."
Ron's stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised
himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray
of moonlight lay across its staring face.
It was Ron Weasley. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck
up in front of him, holding his camera.
"Petrified?" whispered Ron Weasley.
"Yes," said Professor Weasley. "But I shudder to think ... If Ron
hadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows
what might have -"
The three of them stared down at Ron. Then Weasley leaned
forward and wrenched the camera out of Ron's rigid grip.
"You don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?" said
Professor Weasley eagerly.
153
Weasley didn't answer. He opened the back of the camera.
"Good gracious!" said Ron Weasley.
A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Ron, three beds away,
caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.
"Melted," said Ron Weasley wonderingly. "All melted..."
"What does this mean, Ron?" Professor Weasley asked
urgently.
"It means," said Weasley, "that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed
open again."
Ron Weasley clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor Weasley
stared at Weasley.
*180*
"But, Ron ... surely ... who?"
"The question is not who," said Weasley, his eyes on Ron.
"The question is, how . . . ."
And from what Ron could see of Professor Weasley's shad
owy face, she didn't understand this any better than he did.
C H-H A P T t R ELEVEN
THE D-KJEL]ING C-L-IJIB
Ron woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with
winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly
and looked over at Ron's bed, but it had been blocked from view by
the high curtains Ron had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he
was awake, Ron Weasley came bustling over with a breakfast tray
and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.
"All in order," she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded.
"When you've finished eating, you may leave."
Ron dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Weasley
Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Ron about Ron and Ron,
154
but they weren't there. Ron left to look for them, wondering where
they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren't
interested in whether he had his bones back or not.
*182*
As Ron passed the library, Ron Weasley strolled out of it,
looking in far better spirits than last time they'd met.
"Oh, hello, Ron," he said. "Excellent flying yesterday, really
excellent. Weasley has just taken the lead for the House Cup you
earned fifty points!"
"You haven't seen Ron or Ron, have you?" said Ron.
"No, I haven't," said Ron, his smile fading. "I hope Ron's not in
another girls' toilet .....
Ron forced a laugh, watched Ron walk out of sight, and then
headed straight for Moaning Ron's bathroom. He couldn't see why
Ron and Ron would be in there again, but after making sure
that neither Weasley nor any prefects were around, he opened the door
and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.
"It's me," he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a
splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Ron's eye
peering through the keyhole.
`Ron!" she said. "You gave us such a fright - come in how's your
arm?"
"Fine," said Ron, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was
perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Ron
they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires
was a speciality of Ron's.
"We'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the
Polyjuice Potion," Ron explained as Ron, with difficulty, locked the
stall again. "We've decided this is the safest place to hide it."
155
Ron started to tell them about Ron, but Ron interrupted.
"We already know - we heard Professor Weasley telling
Professor Weasley this morning. That's why we decided we'd better get
going -"
"The sooner we get a confession out of Weasley, the better," snarled
Ron. "D'you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after
the Quidditch match, he took it out on Ron."
"There's something else," said Ron, watching Ron tearing
bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. "Ron came
to visit me in the middle of the night."
Ron and Ron looked up, amazed. Ron told them everything
Ron had told him - or hadn't told him. Ron and Ron listened
with their mouths open.
"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?" Ron said.
"This settles it," said Ron in a triumphant voice. "Ron Weasley must've
opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he's told
dear old Ron how to do it. It's obvious. Wish Ron'd told you what
kind of monster's in there, though. I want to know how come nobody's
noticed it sneaking around the school."
"Maybe it can make itself invisible," said Ron, prodding leeches to
the bottom of the cauldron. "Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to
be a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -"
"You read too much, Ron," said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on
top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked
at Ron.
"So Ron stopped us from getting on the train and broke your
arm He shook his head. "You know what, Ron? If he doesn't
stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you."
*184*
156
The news that Ron Weasley had been attacked and was now lying
as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire
school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor
and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in
tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they
ventured forth alone.
Ron Weasley, who sat next to Ron Weasley in Charms, was
distraught, but Ron felt that Ron and Ron were going the
wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering
themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind
statues. They only stopped when Ron, apoplectic with rage, told
them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ron was
having nightmares.
Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans,
amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school.
Ron Weasley bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a
pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other
Weasley boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pureblood,
and therefore unlikely to be attacked.
"They went for Weasley first," Ron said, his round face fearful. "And
everyone knows I'm almost a Squib."
In the second week of December Professor Weasley came
around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at
school for Christmas. Ron, Ron, and Ron signed her list; they
had heard that Weasley was staying, which struck them as very
suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the
Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.
Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still
* 3-85*
needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place
they were going to get them was from Weasley's private stores. Ron
privately felt he'd rather face Weasley's legendary monster than let
Weasley catch him robbing his office.
157
"What we need," said Ron briskly as Thursday afternoon's
double Potions lesson loomed nearer, "is a diversion. Then one of us
can sneak into Weasley's office and take what we need."
Ron and Ron looked at her nervously.
"I think Id better do the actual stealing," Ron continued in a
matter-of-fact tone. "You two will be expelled if you get into any more
trouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause
enough mayhem to keep Weasley busy for five minutes or so.
Ron smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Weasley's Potions
class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons
stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass
scales and jars of ingredients. Weasley prowled through the fumes,
making waspish remarks about the Weasleys' work while the
Weasleys sniggered appreciatively. Ron Weasley, who was Weasley's
favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Ron, who
knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you
could say "Unfair."
Ron's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on
more important things. He was waiting for Ron's signal, and he
hardly listened as Weasley paused to sneer at his watery
*186*
potion. When Weasley turned and walked off to bully Ron, Ron
caught Ron's eye and nodded.
Ron ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Ron's
Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his
wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only
seconds, Ron straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it
landed right on target in Weasley's cauldron.
Weasley's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked
as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Weasley got a faceful and
his nose began to swell like a balloon; Weasley blundered around, his
158
hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate -
Weasley was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened.
Through the confusion, Ron saw Ron slip quietly into Weasley's
office.
"Silence! SILENCE!" Weasley roared. "Anyone who has been splashed,
come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -"
Ron tried not to laugh as he watched Weasley hurry forward, his head
drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the
class lumbered up to Weasley's desk, some weighted down with arms
like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Ron
saw Ron slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes
bulging.
When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings
had subsided, Weasley swept over to Weasley's cauldron and scooped out
the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.
*187*
"If I ever find out who threw this," Weasley whispered, "I shall make
sure that person is expelled."
Ron arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled
expression. Weasley was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten
minutes later could not have been more welcome.
"He knew it was me," Ron told Ron and Ron as they hurried
back to Moaning Ron's bathroom. "I could tell."
Ron threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to
stir feverishly.
"It'll be ready in two weeks," she said happily.
"Weasley can't prove it was you," said Ron reassuringly to Ron.
"What can he do?"
"Knowing Weasley, something foul," said Ron as the potion frothed
and bubbled.
159
A week later, Ron, Ron, and Ron were walking across the
entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around
the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been
pinned up. Ron Weasley and Ron Ron beckoned them
over, looking excited.
"They're starting a Dueling Club!" said Ron. "First meeting
tonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy
one of these days ......
"What, you reckon Weasley's monster can duel?" said Ron, but he,
too, read the sign with interest.
"Could be useful," he said to Ron and Ron as they went into
dinner. "Shall we go?"
Ron and Ron were all for it, so at eight o'clock that
*188*
evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables
had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by
thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety
black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed
beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.
"I wonder who'll be teaching us?" said Ron as they edged into
the chattering crowd. "Someone told me Weasley was a dueling
champion when he was young - maybe it'll be him."
"As long as it's not -" Ron began, but he ended on a groan:
Ron Weasley was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes
of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Weasley, wearing
his usual black.
Weasley waved an arm for silence and called ' "Gather round,
gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me?
Excellent!
"Now, Professor Weasley has granted me permission to start
this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend
yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full
160
details, see my published works.
"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Weasley," said Weasley,
flashing a wide smile. "He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about
dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short
demonstration before we begin. Now, I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm
through with him, never fear!"
"Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off?" Ron muttered in
Ron's ear.
Weasley's upper lip was curling. Ron wondered why Weasley
*189*
was still smiling; if Weasley had been looking at him like that he'd have
been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.
Weasley and Weasley turned to face each other and bowed; at least,
Weasley did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Weasley jerked
his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of
them.
"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative
position," Weasley told the silent crowd. "On the count of three, we
will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course."
"I wouldn't bet on that," Ron murmured, watching Weasley baring his
teeth.
"One - two - three -"
Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them
at their opponent; Weasley cried: "Expelliarmus!" There was a dazzling
flash of scarlet light and Weasley was blasted off his feet: He flew
backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to
sprawl on the floor.
Weasley and some of the other Weasleys cheered. Ron was
dancing on tiptoes. "Do you think he's all right?" she squealed through
her fingers.
161
"Who cares?" said Ron and Ron together.
Weasley was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and
his wavy hair was standing on end.
"Well, there you have it!" he said, tottering back onto the platform.
"That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah,
thank you, Miss Weasley - yes, an excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Weasley, but if you don't mind my saying
*190*
so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to
stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be
instructive to let them see . . ."
Weasley was looking murderous. Possibly Weasley had noticed, because
he said, "Enough demonstrating! I'm going to come amongst you now
and put you all into pairs. Professor Weasley, if you'd like to help me -"
They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Weasley
teamed Ron with Ron Weasley, but Weasley reached Ron
and Ron first.
"Time to split up the dream team, I think," he sneered. "Weasley, you
can partner Weasley. Weasley -"
Ron moved automatically toward Ron.
"I don't think so," said Weasley, smiling coldly. "Mr. Weasley, come over
here. Let's see what you make of the famous Weasley. And you, Miss
Weasley - you can partner Miss Weasley."
Weasley strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Weasley girl who
reminded Ron of a picture he'd seen in Holidays with Hags. She was
large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Ron
gave her a weak smile that she did not return.
"Face your partners!" called Weasley, back on the platform. "And
bow!"
162
Ron and Weasley barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off
each other.
"Wands at the ready!" shouted Weasley. "When I count to three, cast
your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't
want any accidents - one ... two ... three -"
*191*
Ron swung his wand high, but Weasley had already started on "two":
His spell hit Ron so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the
head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be
working, and wasting no more time, Ron pointed his wand straight at
Weasley and shouted, "Rictusempra!"
A jet of silver light hit Weasley in the stomach and he doubled up,
wheezing.
"I said disarm only!" Weasley shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd, as Weasley sank to his knees; Ron had hit him with a
Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Ron hung
back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Weasley
while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath,
Weasley pointed his wand at Ron's knees, choked, "Tarantallegra!"
and the next second Ron's legs began to jerk around out of his
control in a kind of quickstep.
"Stop! Stop!" screamed Weasley, but Weasley took charge.
"Finite Incantatem!" he shouted; Ron's feet stopped dancing, Weasley
stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.
A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Ron
and Ron were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an
ashen-faced Ron, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had
done; but Ron and Ron Weasley were still moving;
Ron had Ron in a headlock and Ron was whimpering
in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Ron leapt
forward and pulled Ron off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger
than he was.
"Dear, dear," said Weasley, skittering through the crowd, looking at
163
the aftermath of the duels. "Up you go, Weasley ....
*192*
Careful there, Miss Fawcett .... Pinch it hard, it'll stop bleeding in a
second, Weasley
"I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells," said
Weasley, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at
Weasley, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. "Let's
have a volunteer pair - Weasley and Weasley, how about
you -"
"A bad idea, Professor Weasley," said Weasley, gliding over like a large
and malevolent bat. "Weasley causes devastation with the simplest
spells. We'll be sending what's left of Weasley up to the
hospital wing in a matchbox." Ron's round, pink face went pinker.
"How about Weasley and Weasley?" said Weasley with a twisted smile.
"Excellent idea!" said Weasley, gesturing Ron and Weasley into the
middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.
"Now, Ron," said Weasley. "When Ron points his wand at you,
you do this."
He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling
action, and dropped it. Weasley smirked as Weasley quickly picked it up,
saying, "Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -"
Weasley moved closer to Weasley, bent down, and whispered something
in his ear. Weasley smirked, too. Ron looked up nervously at Weasley
and said, "Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?"
"Scared?" muttered Weasley, so that Weasley couldn't hear him.
"You wish," said Ron out of the corner of his mouth.
Weasley cuffed Ron merrily on the shoulder. "Just do what I did,
Ron!"
"What, drop my wand?"
164
But Weasley wasn't listening.
"Three - two - one - go!" he shouted.
Weasley raised his wand quickly and bellowed, "Serpensortia!"
The end of his wand exploded. Ron watched, aghast, as a long black
snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and
raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd
backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.
"Don't move, Weasley," said Weasley lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of
Ron standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. "I'll get
rid of it ......
"Allow me!" shouted Weasley. He brandished his wand at the snake
and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten
feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged,
hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Ron Weasley and
raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.
Ron wasn't sure what made him do it. He wasn't even aware of
deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him
forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly
at the snake, "Leave him alone!" And miraculously - inexplicably - the
snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its
eyes now on Ron. Ron felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the
snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn't
have explained.
He looked up at Ron, grinning, expecting to see Ron looking
*194*
relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and
scared.
"What do you think you're playing at?" he shouted, and before Ron
could say anything, Ron had turned and stormed out of the hall.
Weasley stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a
small puff of black smoke. Weasley, too, was looking at Ron in an
165
unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Ron
didn't like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all
around the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.
"Come on," said Rods voice in his ear. "Move - come on -"
Ron steered him out of the hall, Ron hurrying alongside them. As
they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as
though they were frightened of catching something. Ron didn't have
a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Ron explained
anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty
Weasley common room. Then Ron pushed Ron into an armchair
and said, "You're a Parselmouth. Why didn't you tell us?"
"I'm a what?" said Ron.
`A Parselmouth!" said Ron. "You can talk to snakes!"
"I know," said Ron. "I mean, that's only the second time I've ever
done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Ron at the
zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil
and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I
was a wizard -"
"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?" Ron repeated
faintly.
*195*
"So?" said Ron. "I bet loads of people here can do it."
"Oh, no they can't," said Ron. "It's not a very common gift. Ron, this
is bad."
"What's bad?" said Ron, starting to feel quite angry. "What's wrong
with everyone? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Ron -"
"Oh, that's what you said to it?"
"What d'you mean? You were there - you heard me -"
"I heard you speaking Parseltongue," said Ron. "Snake language. You
166
could have been saying anything - no wonder Ron panicked, you
sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was
creepy, you know -"
Ron gaped at him.
"I spoke a different language? But - I didn't realize - how can I speak
a language without knowing I can speak it?"
Ron shook his head. Both he and Ron were looking as though
someone had died. Ron couldn't see what was so terrible.
"D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake
biting off Ron's head?" he said. "What does it matter how I did it as
long as Ron doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt?"
"It matters," said Ron, speaking at last in a hushed voice,
"because being able to talk to snakes was what Ron Weasley was
famous for. That's why the symbol of Weasley House is a serpent."
Ron's mouth fell open.
"Exactly," said Ron. "And now the whole school's going to think you're
his great-great-great-great-grandson or something -"
"But I'm not," said Ron, with a panic he couldn't quite explain.
"You'll find that hard to prove," said Ron. "He lived about a
thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
* IL96 *
Ron lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains
around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the
tower window and wondered . . .
Could he be a descendant of Ron Slithering? He didn't know
anything about his father's family, after all. The Weasleys had always
forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.
Quietly, Ron tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words
wouldn't come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to
167
do it.
But I'm in Weasley, Ron thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn't
have put me in here if I had Weasley blood...
Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to
put you in Weasley, don't you remember?
Ron turned over. He'd see Ron the next day in Herbology and he'd
explain that he'd been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he
thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.
By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had
turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the
term was canceled: Professor Weasley wanted to fit socks and scarves
on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else,
now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and
revive Mrs. Norris and Ron Weasley.
Ron fretted about this next to the fire in the Weasley common
room, while Ron and Ron used their time off to play a game of
wizard chess.
"For heaven's sake, Ron," said Ron, exasperated, as one
*197*
of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off
the board. "Go and find Ron if it's so important to you."
So Ron got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where
Ron might be.
The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the
thick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Ron walked
past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of
what was happening within. Professor Weasley was shouting at
someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger.
Resisting the urge to take a look, Ron walked on by, thinking that
Ron might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and
deciding to check the library first.
168
A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were
indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn't seem to be
working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Ron could see
that their heads were close together and they were having what looked
like an absorbing conversation. He couldn't see whether Ron was
among them. He was walking toward them when something of what
they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the
Invisibility section.
"So anyway," a stout boy was saying, "I told Ron to hide up in our
dormitory. I mean to say, if Weasley's marked him down as his next
victim, it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Ron's
been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to
Weasley he was Muggle-born. Ron actually told him he'd been down
for Eton. That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Weasley's
heir on the loose, is it?"
"You definitely think it is Weasley, then, Ron?" said a girl with blonde
pigtails anxiously.
198
"Ron," said the stout boy solemnly, "he's a Parselmouth. Everyone
knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a
decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Weasley himself
Serpent-tongue."
There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ron went on,
"Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir,
Beware. Weasley had some sort of run-in with Weasley. Next thing we
know, Flich's cat's attacked. That first year, Weasley, was annoying
Weasley at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was
lying in the mud. Next thing we know - Weasley's been attacked."
"He always seems so nice, though," said Ron uncertainly, "and,
well, he's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can't be
all bad, can he?"
Ron lowered his voice mysteriously, the Weasleys bent closer, and
Ron edged nearer so that he could catch Ron's words.
"No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I
169
mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have
been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard
could have survived a curse like that." He dropped his voice until it
was barely more than a whisper, and said, "That's probably why You-
Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want another
Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Weasley's
been hiding?"
Ron couldn't take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out
from behind the bookshelves. If he hadn't been feeling so angry, he
would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the
Weasleys looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of
him, and the color was draining out of Ron's face.
*199*
"Hello," said Ron. "I'm looking for Ron Weasley."
The Hufepuffs' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all
looked fearfully at Ron.
"What do you want with him?" said Ron in a quavering voice.
"I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the
Dueling Club," said Ron.
Ron bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, "We
were all there. We saw what happened."
"Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?"
said Ron.
"All I saw," said Ron stubbornly, though he was trembling as he
spoke, "was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake
toward Ron. "
"I didn't chase it at him!" Ron said, his voice shaking with anger. "It
didn't even touch him!"
"It was a very near miss," said Ron. "And in case you're getting
ideas," he added hastily, "I might tell you that you can trace my
family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and
170
my blood's as pure as anyone's, so -"
- cc I don't care what sort of blood you've got!" said Ron fiercely.
"Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?"
"I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with," said Ron swiftly.
"It's not possible to live with the Weasleys and not hate them," said
Ron. "Id like to see you try it."
He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself
a reproving glare from Ron Weasley, who was polishing the gilded
cover of a large spellbook.
*200*
Ron blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going,
he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something
very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.
"Oh, hello, Weasley," Ron said, looking up.
Weasley's face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered
balaclava, but it couldn't possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of
the corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging
from one of his massive, gloved hands.
"All righ', Ron?" he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could
speak. "Why aren't yeh in class?"
"Canceled," said Ron, getting up. "What're you doing in here?"
Weasley held up the limp rooster.
"Second one killed this term," he explained. "It's either foxes or a
Blood-Suckin Bugbear, an' I need the Headmaster's permission ter
put a charm around the hen coop."
He peered more closely at Ron from under his thick, snowflecked
eyebrows.
"Yeh sure yeh're all righ'? Yeh look all hot an' bothered -"
171
Ron couldn't bring himself to repeat what Ron and the rest of the
Weasleys had been saying about him.
"It's nothing," he said. "Id better get going, Weasley, it's Transfiguration
next and I've got to pick up my books."
He walked off, his mind still full of what Ron had said about him.
"Ron's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he
let slip to Weasley he was Muggle-born .....
* 2 0 IL *
Ron stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor,
which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a
strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He
was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over
something lying on the floor.
He turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though his
stomach had dissolved.
Ron Weasley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of
shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And
that wasn't all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight
Ron had ever seen.
It was Nearly Headless Ron, no longer pearly-white and
transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal,
six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an
expression of shock identical to Ron's.
Ron got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a
kind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the
deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they
could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled
voices of teachers from the classes on either side.
He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But
he couldn't just leave them lying here .... He had to get help ....
Would anyone believe he hadn't had anything to do with this?
172
As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a
bang. Ron the Poltergeist came shooting out.
"Why, it's potty wee Weasley!" cackled Ron, knocking Ron's
glasses askew as he bounced past him. "What's Weasley up to? Why's
Weasley lurking -"
*202*
Ron stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down,
he spotted Ron and Nearly Headless Ron. He flipped the right
way up, filled his lungs and, before Ron could stop him, screamed,
"ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL
OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!
ATTAAAACK!"
Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor
and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene
of such confusion that Ron was in danger of being squashed and
people kept standing in Nearly Headless Ron. Ron found himself
pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor
Weasley came running, followed by her own class, one of whom
still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off
aloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into
their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ron
the Weasley arrived, panting, on the scene.
"Caught in the act!" Ron yelled, his face stark white, pointing his
finger dramatically at Ron.
"That will do, Weasley!" said Professor Weasley sharply.
Ron was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the
scene; Ron always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Ron
and Nearly Headless Ron, examining them, Ron broke into song:
"Oh, Weasley, you rotter, oh, what have you done,
You're killing off' students, you think it's good fun -"
"That's enough Ron!" barked Professor Weasley, and Ron
zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Ron.
173
*203*
Ron was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Weasley and
Professor Weasley of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed
to know what to do for Nearly Headless Ron. In the end, Professor
Weasley conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to
Ron with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Ron up the stairs.
This Ron did, fanning Ron along like a silent black hovercraft. This
left Ron and Professor Weasley alone together.
"This way, Weasley," she said.
"Professor," said Ron at once, "I swear I didn't -"
"This is out of my hands, Weasley," said Professor Weasley curtly.
They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a
large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.
"Lemon drop!" she said. This was evidently a password, because the
gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind
him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Ron
couldn't fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that
was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor
Weasley stepped onto it, Ron heard the wall thud closed behind
them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last,
slightly dizzy, Ron saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass
knocker in the shape of a griffin.
He knew now where he was being taken. This must be where
Weasley lived.
*204*
C I3 A P T V RR T W E I V
THE POLYJUICE POTION
hey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor
Weasley rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered.
Professor Weasley told Ron to wait and left him there, alone.
174
Ron looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers'
offices Ron had visited so far this year, Weasley's was by far
the most interesting. If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he
was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very
pleased to have a chance to look around it.
It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A
number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables,
whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered
with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom
were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous,
claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered
wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat.
*205*
Ron hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and
wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down
and tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him in
the right House
He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and
lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped
down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on.
Ron stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice
said in his ear, "Bee in your bonnet, Ron Weasley?"
"Er, yes," Ron muttered. "Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask -
"
"You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House," said
the hat smartly. "Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But I
stand by what I said before" - Ron's heart leapt - "you would have
done well in Weasley -"
Ron's stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and
pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Ron
pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.
175
"You're wrong," he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn't move.
Ron backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind
him made him wheel around.
He wasn't alone after all. Ronding on a golden perch behind the door
was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey.
Ron stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its
gagging noise again. Ron thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull
and, even as Ron watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.
Ron was just thinking that all he needed was for Weasley's
pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird
burst into flames.
Ron yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked
feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but
couldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave
one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering
pile of ash on the floor.
The office door opened. Weasley came in, looking very somber.
"Professor," Ron gasped. "Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he just
caught fire -"
To Ron's astonishment, Weasley smiled.
"About time, too," he said. "He's been looking dreadful for days; I've
been telling him to get a move on."
He chuckled at the stunned look on Ron's face.
"Ron is a phoenix, Ron. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is
time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . ."
Ron looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke
its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.
"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day," said Weasley,
seating himself behind his desk. "He's really very handsome most of
the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures,
176
phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have
healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets."
In the shock of Ron catching fire, Ron had forgotten what he
was there for, but it all came back to him as Weasley settled
himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Ron with his
penetrating, light-blue stare.
Before Weasley could speak another word, however, the door of
the office flew open with an almighty bang and Weasley burst in, a wild
look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head
and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.
"It wasn' Ron, Professor Weasley!" said Weasley urgently. "I was
talkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir -
"
Weasley tried to say something, but Weasley went ranting on,
waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers
everywhere.
"- it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I
have to -"
"Weasley, I -"
"- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Ron never ='
"Weasley!" said Weasley loudly. "I do not think that Ron
attacked those people."
"Oh," said Weasley, the rooster falling limply at his side. "Right. I'll wait
outside then, Headmaster."
And he stomped out looking embarrassed.
"You don't think it was me, Professor?" Ron repeated hopefully as
Weasley brushed rooster feathers off his desk.
"No, Ron, I don't," said Weasley, though his face was somber
again. "But I still want to talk to you."
177
Ron waited nervously while Weasley considered him, the tips of
his long fingers together.
*208*
"I must ask you, Ron, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,"
he said gently. "Anything at all."
Ron didn't know what to say. He thought of Weasley shouting, "You'll
be next, Mudbloods!" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in
Moaning Ron's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied
voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said:
"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the
wizarding world." He thought, too, about what everyone was saying
about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected
with Ron Weasley ....
"No," said Ron. "There isn't anything, Professor . . . ."
The double attack on Ron and Nearly Headless Ron turned what
had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly
Headless Ron's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could
possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible
power could harm someone who was already dead? There was
almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that
students could go home for Christmas.
"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left," Ron told Ron and
Ron. "Us, Weasley, Weasley, and Weasley. What a jolly holiday it's
going to be."
Weasley and Weasley, who always did whatever Weasley did, had signed
up to stay over the holidays, too. But Ron was glad that most people
were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the
corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired
of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.
*209*
Ron and Ron, however, found all this very funny. They went out of
their way to march ahead of Ron down the corridors, shouting,
178
"Make way for the Heir of Weasley, seriously evil wizard coming
through ......
Ron was deeply disapproving of this behavior.
"It is not a laughing matter," he said coldly.
"Oh, get out of the way, Ron," said Ron. "Ron's in a hurry."
"Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his
fanged servant," said Ron, chortling.
Ron didn't find it amusing either.
"Oh, don't," she wailed every time Ron asked Ron loudly who he
was planning to attack next, or when Ron pretended to ward Ron
off with a large clove of garlic when they met.
Ron didn't mind; it made him feel better that Ron and Ron, at
least, thought the idea of his being Weasley's heir was quite ludicrous.
But their antics seemed to be aggravating Ron Weasley, who looked
increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.
"It's because he's bursting to say it's really him," said Ron knowingly.
"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you're
getting all the credit for his dirty work."
"Not for long," said Ron in a satisfied tone. "The Polyjuice
Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any day
now."
At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds
descended on the castle. Ron found it peaceful, rather than gloomy,
and enjoyed the fact that he, Ron, and the Weasleys had the run
of Weasley Tower, which meant they could
*210*
play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice
dueling in private. Ron, Ron, and Ron had chosen to stay at
school rather than visit Ron in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
Ron, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior,
179
didn't spend much time in the Weasley common room. He had
already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas
because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during
this troubled time.
Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Ron and Ron, the only
ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Ron,
who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.
"Wake up," she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.
"Ron - you're not supposed to be in here -" said Ron, shielding
his eyes against the light.
"Merry Christmas to you, too," said Ron, throwing him his
present. "I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to
the potion. It's ready."
Ron sat up, suddenly wide awake.
"Are you sure?"
"Positive," said Ron, shifting Ron the rat so that she could
sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. "If we're going to do it, I
say it should be tonight."
At that moment, Ron swooped into the room, carrying a very
small package in her beak.
"Hello," said Ron happily as she landed on his bed. "Are you
speaking to me again?"
211
She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far
better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned
out to be from the Weasleys. They had sent Ron a toothpick and a
note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts
for the summer vacation, too.
The rest of Ron's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory.
Weasley had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Ron decided
180
to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called
Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite
Quidditch team, and Ron had bought him a luxury eagle-feather
quill. Ron opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted
sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card
with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which
hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the
bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.
No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later,
could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.
The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen
frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and
mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling,
warm and dry, from the ceiling. Weasley led them in a few of his
favorite carols, Weasley booming more and more loudly with every
goblet of eggnog he consumed. Ron, who hadn't noticed that Ron
had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read "Pinhead," kept
asking them all what they were sniggering at. Ron didn't even care
that Ron Weasley was making loud, snide remarks
* 2:L2 *
about his new sweater from the Weasley table. With a bit of luck,
Weasley would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time.
Ron and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas
pudding when Ron ushered them out of the hall to finalize their
plans for the evening.
"We still need a bit of the people you're changing into," said
Ron matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the
supermarket for laundry detergent. "And obviously, it'll be best if you
can get something of Weasley's and Weasley's; they're Weasleys best
friends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the
real Weasley and Weasley can't burst in on us while we're interrogating
him.
"I've got it all worked out," she went on smoothly, ignoring Ron's
and Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes.
"I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is
181
make sure Weasley and Weasley find them. You know how greedy they
are, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few of
their hairs and hide them in a broom closet."
Ron and Ron looked incredulously at each other.
"Ron, I don't think -"
"That could go seriously wrong -"
But Ron had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one
Professor Weasley sometimes had.
"The potion will be useless without Weasley's and Weasley's hair," she
said sternly. "You do want to investigate Weasley, don't you?"
"Oh, all right, all right," said Ron. "But what about you? Whose hair
are you ripping out?"
*213*
"I've already got mine!" said Ron brightly, pulling a tiny bottle
out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it.
"Remember Ron Weasley wrestling with me at the Dueling
Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me!
And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the
Weasleys I've decided to come back."
When Ron had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion
again, Ron turned to Ron with a doom-laden expression.
"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go
wrong?"
But to Ron's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the
operation went just as smoothly as Ron had said. They lurked
in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Weasley
and Weasley who had remained alone at the Weasley table, shoveling
down fourth helpings of trifle. Ron had perched the chocolate
cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Weasley and
Weasley coming out of the Great Hall, Ron and Ron hid quickly
behind a suit of armor next to the front door.
182
"How thick can you get?" Ron whispered ecstatically as Weasley
gleefully pointed out the cakes to Weasley and grabbed them. Grinning
stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a
moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their
faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both
keeled over backward onto the floor.
By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall.
Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Ron
yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Weasley's fore
* _2 14 *
head and Ron pulled out several of Weasley's hairs. They also stole
their shoes, because their own were far too small for Weasley- and
Weasley-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they
sprinted up to Moaning Ron's bathroom.
They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall
in which Ron was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up
over their faces, Ron and Ron knocked softly on the door.
"Ron?"
They heard the scrape of the lock and Ron emerged, shinyfaced
and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop
of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on
the toilet seat.
"Did you get them?" Ron asked breathlessly.
Ron showed her Weasley's hair.
"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry," Ron
said, holding up a small sack. "You'll need bigger sizes once you're
Weasley and Weasley."
The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked
like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.
"I'm sure I've done everything right," said Ron, nervously
183
rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. "It looks like the
book says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour
before we change back into ourselves."
"Now what?" Ron whispered.
"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs."
Ron ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses.
Then, her hand trembling, she shook Ron Weasley's hair out of
its bottle into the first glass.
*215*
The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A
second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.
"Urgh - essence of Ron Weasley," said Ron, eyeing it with
loathing. "Bet it tastes disgusting."
"Add yours, then," said Ron.
Ron dropped Weasley's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Weasley's
into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Weasley's turned the
khaki color of a booger, Weasley's a dark, murky brown.
"Hang on," said Ron as Ron and Ron reached for their glasses.
"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Weasley
and Weasley we won't fit. And Ron Weasley's no pixie.
"Good thinking," said Ron, unlocking the door. "We'll take separate
stalls."
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Ron slipped into
the middle stall.
"Ready?" he called.
"Ready," came Ron's and Ron's voices.
"One - two - three -"
184
Pinching his nose, Ron drank the potion down in two large gulps. It
tasted like overcooked cabbage.
Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed
live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be
sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the
very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all
fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body
bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow,
the fingers thickened, the nails broadened,
* 2116 *
the knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully
and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down
toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a
barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too
small
As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Ron lay facedown
on the stone-cold floor, listening to Ron gurgling morosely in the end
toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was
what it felt like, being Weasley. His large hand trembling, he pulled off
his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on
the spare ones, and laced up Weasley's boatlike shoes. He reached up to
brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry
bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were
clouding his eyes because Weasley obviously didn't need them - he took
them off and called, "Are you two okay?" Weasley's low rasp of a voice
issued from his mouth.
"Yeah," came the deep grunt of Weasley from his right.
Ron unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.
Weasley stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Ron scratched
his ear. So did Weasley.
Ron's door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked
pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Weasley, from the
pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.
"This is unbelievable," said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding
185
Weasley's flat nose. "Unbelievable. "
"We'd better get going," said Ron, loosening the watch that was
cutting into Weasley's thick wrist. "We've still got to find out
* 217*
where the Weasley common room is. I only hope we can find
someone to follow. . ."
Ron, who had been gazing at Ron, said, "You don't know how
bizarre it is to see Weasley thinking." He banged on Ron's door.
"C'mon, we need to go -"
A high-pitched voice answered him.
"I - I don't think I'm going to come after all. You go on without me.
"Ron, we know Ron Weasley's ugly, no one's going to
know it's you -"
"No - really - I don't think I'll come. You two hurry up, you re
wasting time
Ron looked at Ron, bewildered.
"That looks more like Weasley," said Ron. "That's how he looks every
time a teacher asks him a question."
"Ron, are you okay?" said Ron through the door.
"Fine - I'm fine - go on -"
Ron looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had
already passed.
"We'll meet you back here, all right?" he said.
Ron and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked
that the coast was clear, and set off.
"Don't swing your arms like that," Ron muttered to Ron.
186
"Eh?"
"Weasley holds them sort of stiff . . . ."
"How's this?"
"Yeah, that's better . . . ."
They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was
*218*
a Weasley that they could follow to the Weasley common room, but
there was nobody around.
"Any ideas?" muttered Ron.
"The Weasleys always come up to breakfast from over there," said
Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely
left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the
entrance.
"Excuse me," said Ron, hurrying up to her. "We've forgotten the way
to our common room."
"I beg your pardon?" said the girl stiffly. "Our common room? I'm a
Weasley."
She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.
Ron and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their
footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Weasley's and Weasley's huge
feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they
had hoped.
The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and
deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see
how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when
they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.
"Ha!" said Ron excitedly. "There's one of them now!"
187
The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer,
however, their hearts sank. It wasn't a Weasley, it was Ron.
"What're you doing down here?" said Ron in surprise.
Ron looked affronted.
"That," he said stiffly, "is none of your business. It's Weasley, isn't it?"
2 19
"Wh - oh, yeah," said Ron.
"Well, get off to your dormitories," said Ron sternly. "It's not safe to
go wandering around dark corridors these days."
"You are," Ron pointed out.
"I," said Ron, drawing himself up, "am a prefect. Nothing's about to
attack me."
A voice suddenly echoed behind Ron and Ron. Ron Weasley was
strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Ron was
pleased to see him.
"There you are," he drawled, looking at them. "Have you two been
pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I've been looking for you; I
want to show you something really funny."
Weasley glanced witheringly at Ron.
"And what're you doing down here, Weasley?" he sneered.
Ron looked outraged.
"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!" he said. "I
don't like your attitude!"
Weasley sneered and motioned for Ron and Ron to follow him. Ron
almost said something apologetic to Ron but caught himself just in
time. He and Ron hurried after Weasley, who said as they turned into
188
the next passage, "That Ron Weasley -"
"Ron," Ron corrected him automatically.
"Whatever," said Weasley. "I've noticed him sneaking around a lot
lately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catch
Weasley's heir single-handed."
He gave a short, derisive laugh. Ron and Ron exchanged excited
looks.
Weasley paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.
* 220 *
"What's the new password again?" he said to Ron.
"Er -" said Ron.
"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!" said Weasley, not listening, and a stone door
concealed in the wall slid open. Weasley marched through it, and
Ron and Ron followed him.
The Weasley common room was a long, low underground room
with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps
were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately
carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Weasleys were
silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.
"Wait here," said Weasley to Ron and Ron, motioning them to a pair
of empty chairs set back from the fire. "I'll go and get it my father's
just sent it to me -"
Wondering what Weasley was going to show them, Ron and Ron
sat down, doing their best to look at home.
Weasley came back a minute later, holding what looked like a
newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron's nose.
"That'll give you a laugh," he said.
Ron saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly,
189
gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Ron.
It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:
INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Ron Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office,
was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.
Mr. Ron Weasley, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry, where the
221
enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr.
Weasley's resignation.
"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute," Mr. Weasley told our
reporter. "He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous
Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately."
Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told
reporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them.
"Well?" said Weasley impatiently as Ron handed the clipping back to
him. "Don't you think it's funny?"
"Ha, ha," said Ron bleakly.
"Ron Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in
half and go and join them," said Weasley scornfully. "You'd never know
the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave."
Ron's - or rather, Weasley's - face was contorted with fury.
"What's up with you, Weasley?" snapped Weasley.
"Stomachache," Ron grunted.
"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick
from me," said Weasley, snickering. "You know, I'm surprised the Daily
Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet," he went on thoughtfully.
190
"I suppose Weasley's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if it
doesn't stop soon. Ronher's always said old Weasley's the worst
thing that's ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A
decent headmaster would never've let slime like that Weasley in."
*222*
Weasley started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a
cruel but accurate impression of Ron: "`Weasley, can I have your
picture, Weasley? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes,
please, Weasley?"'
He dropped his hands and looked at Ron and Ron.
"What's the matter with you two?"
Far too late, Ron and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Weasley
seemed satisfied; perhaps Weasley and Weasley were always slow on
the uptake.
"Saint Weasley, the Mudbloods' friend," said Weasley slowly. "He's
another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around
with that jumped up Weasley Mudblood. And people think he's
Weasley's heir!"
Ron and Ron waited with bated breath: Weasley was surely seconds
away from telling them it was him - but then
"I wish I knew who it is," said Weasley petulantly. "I could help them."
Ron's jaw dropped so that Weasley looked even more clueless than
usual. Fortunately, Weasley didn't notice, and Ron, thinking fast,
said, "You must have some idea who's behind it all ......
"You know I haven't, Weasley, how many times do I have to tell you?"
snapped Weasley. "And Ronher won't tell me anything about the last
time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years
ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says
that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much
about it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before
one of them's killed this time .... I hope it's Weasley," he said with
191
relish.
Ron was clenching Weasley's gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a
bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Weasley, Ron shot him a warning
look and said, "D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber
last time was caught?"
"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled," said Weasley. "They're
probably still in Azkaban."
"Azkaban?" said Ron, puzzled.
"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Weasley," said Weasley, looking at him in
disbelief "Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going
backward."
He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, "Ronher says to keep my
head down and let the Heir of Weasley get on with it. He says the
school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed
up in it. Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. You
know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?"
Ron tried to force Weasley's dull face into a look of concern.
"Yeah. . ." said Weasley. "Luckily, they didn't find much. Ronher's got
some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we've got our own
secret chamber under the drawing-room floor
-"
"Ho!" said Ron.
Weasley looked at him. So did Ron. Ron blushed. Even his hair was
turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was
up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror
he was suddenly giving Ron, he must be, too.
They both jumped to their feet.
"Medicine for my stomach," Ron grunted, and without further ado
they sprinted the length of the Weasley common room, hurled
themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping
192
against hope that Weasley hadn't noticed anything. Ron
224
could feel his feet slipping around in Weasley's huge shoes and had to
hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark
entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the
closet where they'd locked Weasley and Weasley. Leaving their shoes
outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble
staircase toward Moaning Ron's bathroom.
"Well, it wasn't a complete waste of time," Ron panted, closing the
bathroom door behind them. "I know we still haven't found out who's
doing the attacks, but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him
to check under the Weasleys' drawing room."
Ron checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal.
He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Ron's
stall.
"Ron, come out, we've got loads to tell you -"
"Go away!" Ron squeaked.
Ron and Ron looked at each other.
"What's the matter?" said Ron. "You must be back to normal by now,
we are
But Moaning Ron glided suddenly through the stall door. Ron had
never seen her looking so happy.
"Ooooooh, wait till you see," she said. "It's awful-"
They heard the lock slide back and Ron emerged, sobbing, her
robes pulled up over her head.
"What's up?" said Ron uncertainly. "Have you still got Ron's nose
or something?"
Ron let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.
193
Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and
there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.
"It was a c-cat hair!" she howled. "M-Ron Weasley
*225*
m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn't supposed to be used for
animal transformations!"
"Uh-oh," said Ron.
"You'll be teased something dreadful," said Ron happily.
"It's okay, Ron," said Ron quickly. "We'll take you up to the
hospital wing. Ron Weasley never asks too many questions ......
It took a long time to persuade Ron to leave the bathroom.
Moaning Ron sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. "Wait
till everyone finds out you've got a tail!"
ermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a
flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school
arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course
everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed
past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Ron
Weasley took out her curtains again and placed them around
Ron's bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry
face.
Ron and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term
started, they brought her each day's homework.
"If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work," said Ron, tipping
a stack of books onto Ron's bedside table one evening.
"Don't be silly, Ron, I've got to keep up," said Ron briskly. Her
spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had
* "21 *
194
gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown.
"I don't suppose you've got any new leads?" she added in a whisper,
so that Ron Weasley couldn't hear her.
"Nothing," said Ron gloomily.
"I was so sure it was Weasley," said Ron, for about the hundredth time.
"What's that?" asked Ron, pointing to something gold sticking out
from under Ron's pillow.
"Just a get well card," said Ron hastily, trying to poke it out of
sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open,
and read aloud:
"To Miss Weasley, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned
teacher, Professor Ron Weasley, Order of Merlin, Third Class,
Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner
of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award. "
Ron looked up at Ron, disgusted.
"You sleep with this under your pillow?"
But Ron was spared answering by Ron Weasley sweeping
over with her evening dose of medicine.
"Is Weasley the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what?" Ron
said to Ron as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs
toward Weasley Tower. Weasley had given them so much
homework, Ron thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before
he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Ron
how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising
Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their
ears.
"That's Weasley," Ron muttered as they hurried up the stairs and
paused, out of sight, listening hard.
* 228*
195
"You don't think someone else's been attacked?" said Ron tensely.
They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich's voice, which
sounded quite hysterical.
`= even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough to
do! No, this is the final straw, I'm going to Weasley -"
His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a
distant door slam.
They poked their heads around the corner. Weasley had clearly been
manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot
where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what
Weasley had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over
half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from
under the door of Moaning Ron's bathroom. Now that Weasley had
stopped shouting, they could hear Ron's wails echoing off the
bathroom walls.
"Now what's up with her?" said Ron.
"Let's go and see," said Ron, and holding their robes over their
ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door
bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.
Moaning Ron was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever
before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in
the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great
rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.
"What's up, Ron?" said Ron.
"Who's that?" glugged Ron miserably. "Come to throw something
else at me?"
Ron waded across to her stall and said, "Why would I throw
something at you?"
*229*
"Don't ask me," Ron shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more
196
water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. "Here I am,
minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a
book at me ......
"But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you," said
Ron, reasonably. "I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't
it?"
He had said the wrong thing. Ron puffed herself up and shrieked,
"Let's all throw books at Ron, because she can't feel it! Ten points
if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through
her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don't think!"
"Who threw it at you, anyway?" asked Ron.
"I don't know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about
death, and it fell right through the top of my head," said Ron,
glaring at them. "It's over there, it got washed out ......
Ron and Ron looked under the sink where Ron was pointing. A
small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as
wet as everything else in the bathroom. Ron stepped forward to
pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.
"What?" said Ron.
"Are you crazy?" said Ron. "It could be dangerous."
"Dangerous?"said Ron, laughing. "Come off it, how could it be
dangerous?"
"You'd be surprised," said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at
the book. "Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated Dad's told
me - there was one that burned your eyes out. And
*2%0*
everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest
of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could
never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it,
trying to do everything one-handed. And -"
197
"All right, I've got the point," said Ron.
The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.
"Well, we won't find out unless we look at it," he said, and he ducked
around Ron and picked it up off the floor.
Ron saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover
told him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page
he could just make out the name "T M. Weasley" in smudged ink.
"Hang on," said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking
over Ron's shoulder. "I know that name .... T. M. Weasley got an
award for special services to the school fifty years ago."
"How on earth d'you know that?" said Ron in amazement.
"Because Weasley made me polish his shield about fifty times in
detention," said Ron resentfully. "That was the one I burped slugs all
over. If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it,
too."
Ron peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank.
There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even
Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three.
"He never wrote in it," said Ron, disappointed.
"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?" said Ron curiously.
Ron turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name
of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.
*231 *
"He must've been Muggle-born," said Ron thoughtfufly. "To have
bought a diary from Vauxhall Road ......
"Well, it's not much use to you," said Ron. He dropped his voice. "Fifty
points if you can get it through Ron's nose."
Ron, however, pocketed it.
198
Ron left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at
the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Weasley
Tower, Ron showed her T. M. Weasley's diary and told her the story
of how they had found it.
"Oooh, it might have hidden powers," said Ron enthusiastically,
taking the diary and looking at it closely.
"If it has, it's hiding them very well," said Ron. "Maybe it's shy. I don't
know why you don't chuck it, Ron."
"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it," said Ron. "I
wouldn't mind knowing how Weasley got an award for special services
to Hogwarts either."
"Could've been anything," said Ron. "Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or
saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Ron; that
would've done everyone a favor .....
But Ron could tell from the arrested look on Ron's face that
she was thinking what he was thinking.
"What?" said Ron, looking from one to the other.
"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?"
he said. "That's what Weasley said."
"Yeah. . ." said Ron slowly.
"And this diary is fifty years old," said Ron, tapping it excitedly.
*232*
a so?
.
"Oh, Ron, wake up," snapped Ron. "We know the person who
opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know
T. M. Weasley got an award for special services to the school fifty years
ago. Well, what if Weasley got his special award for catching the Heir of
199
Weasley? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the
Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it -
the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying
around, would they?"
"That's a brilliant theory, Ron," said Ron, "with just one tiny little
flaw. There's nothing written in his diary."
But Ron was pulling her wand out of her bag.
"It might be invisible ink!" she whispered.
She tapped the diary three times and said, "Aparecium!"
Nothing happened. Undaunted, Ron shoved her hand back into
her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.
"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley," she said.
She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.
"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there," said Ron. "Weasley just
got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in."
Ron couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw
Weasley's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary
was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages,
as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Ron was
sure he had never heard the name T. M. Weasley before, it still seemed
to mean something to him, almost as though
* 233 *
Weasley was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and had
halfforgotten. But this was absurd. He'd never had friends before
Hogwarts, Ron had made sure of that.
Nevertheless, Ron was determined to find out more about Weasley, so
next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Weasley's
special award, accompanied by an interested Ron and a
thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the
trophy room to last him a lifetime.
200
Weasley's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It
didn't carry details of why it had been given to him ("Good thing, too,
or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it," said Ron). However,
they did find Weasley's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on
a list of old Head Boys.
"He sounds like Ron," said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust.
"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -"
"You say that like it's a bad thing," said Ron in a slightly hurt
voice.
The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside
the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no
more attacks since those on Ron and Nearly Headless Ron, and
Ron Weasley was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were
becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving
childhood.
"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,"
Ron heard her telling Weasley kindly one afternoon. "And after that, it
won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll
have Mrs. Norris back in no time."
* 243 *
Perhaps the Heir of Weasley had lost his or her nerve, thought Ron.
It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets,
with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster,
whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for
another fifty years ....
Ron Weasley of Weasley didn't take this cheerful view. He was
still convinced that Ron was the guilty one, that he had "given
himself away" at the Dueling Club. Ron wasn't helping matters; he
kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing "Oh, Weasley, you
rotter . . ." now with a dance routine to match.
Ron Weasley seemed to think he himself had made the attacks
stop. Ron overheard him telling Professor Weasley so while the
Weasleys were lining up for Transfiguration.
201
"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Ron," he said, tapping
his nose knowingly and winking. "I think the Chamber has been locked
for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter
of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I
came down hard on him.
"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash
away the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but I
think I know just the thing . . . ."
He tapped his nose again and strode off.
Weasley's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on
February fourteenth. Ron hadn't had much sleep because of a laterunning
Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to
the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'd
walked through the wrong doors.
The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse
* 235*
still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Ron
went over to the Weasley table, where Ron was sitting looking
sickened, and Ron seemed to have been overcome with giggles.
"What's going on?" Ron asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti
off his bacon.
Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak.
Weasley, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was
waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking
stony-faced. From where he sat, Ron could see a muscle going in
Professor Weasley's cheek. Weasley looked as though someone had
just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.
"Happy Valentine's Day!" Weasley shouted. "And may I thank the
forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the
liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end
here!"
202
Weasley clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall
marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however.
Weasley had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.
"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!" beamed Weasley. "They will be
roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun
doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the
spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Weasley to show you how
to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Weasley
knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've
ever met, the sly old dog!"
Professor Weasley buried his face in his hands. Weasley was look
* 236
ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be
force-fed poison.
"Please, Ron, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron
as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Ron suddenly
became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and
didn't answer.
All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver
valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as
the Weasleys were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs
caught up with Ron.
"Oy, you! 'Arty Weasley!" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,
elbowing people out of the way to get to Ron.
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line
of first years, which happened to include Ron Weasley, Ron tried
to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by
kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces.
"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Weasley in person," he
said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.
"Not here," Ron hissed, trying to escape.
203
"Stay still!" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Ron's bag and pulling
him back.
"Let me go!" Ron snarled, tugging.
With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand,
parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed
over everything.
Ron scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf
started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.
*237*
"What's going on here?" came the cold, drawling voice of Ron
Weasley. Ron started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped
bag, desperate to get away before Weasley could hear his musical
valentine.
"What's all this commotion?" said another familiar voice as Ron
Weasley arrived.
Losing his head, Ron tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf
seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.
"Right," he said, sitting on Ron's ankles. "Here is your singing
valentine:
His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,
His hair is as dark as a blackboard.
I wish he was mine, he's really divine,
The hero who conquered the Dark Lord
Ron would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the
spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his
feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Ron Weasley did his
best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.
"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class,
now," he said, shooing some of the younger students away. "And you,
Weasley-"
204
Ron, glancing over, saw Weasley stoop and snatch up something.
Ronring, he showed it to Weasley and Weasley, and Ron realized that
he'd got Weasley's diary.
"Give that back," said Ron quietly.
"Wonder what Weasley's written in this?" said Weasley, who obvi
* 238
ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had
Ron's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ron was staring
from the diary to Ron, looking terrified.
"Hand it over, Weasley," said Ron sternly.
"When I've had a look," said Weasley, waving the diary tauntingly at
Ron.
Ron said, "As a school prefect -" but Ron had lost his temper. He
pulled out his wand and shouted, "Expelliarmus!" and just as
Weasley had disarmed Weasley, so Weasley found the diary shooting
out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.
"Ron!" said Ron loudly. "No magic in the corridors. I'll have to
report this, you know!"
But Ron didn't care, he was one-up on Weasley, and that was worth
five points from Weasley any day. Weasley was looking furious, and
as Ron passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after
her, "I don't think Weasley liked your valentine much!"
Ron covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling,
Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Ron pulled him away. Ron didn't
need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.
It wasn't until they had reached Professor Weasley's class that Ron
noticed something rather odd about Weasley's diary. All his other
books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as
clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He
tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his
205
wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end,
and he wasn't much interested in anything else.
Ron went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This
was partly because he didn't think he could stand Ron and Ron
singing, "His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad" one more time,
and partly because he wanted to examine Weasley's diary again, and
knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.
Ron sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not
one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new
bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a
blot onto the first page of the diary.
The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it
was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Ron loaded up
his quill a second time and wrote, "My name is Ron Weasley."
The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without
trace. Then, at last, something happened.
Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Ron
had never written.
"Hello, Ron Weasley. My name is Ron Weasley. How did you come by my
diary?"
These words, too, faded away, but not before Ron had started to
scribble back.
"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet."
He waited eagerly for Weasley's reply.
"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink.
But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this
diary read. "
"What do you mean?" Ron scrawled, blotting the page in his
excitement.
*240*
206
`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were
covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. "
"That's where I am now," Ron wrote quickly. "I'm at Hogwarts, and
horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the
Chamber of Secrets?"
His heart was hammering. Weasley's reply came quickly, his writing
becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.
"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it
was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the
Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally
killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was
expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing
had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given
out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny,
engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I
knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the
power to release it was not imprisoned. "
Ron nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.
"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one
seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?"
"I can show you, if you like, "came Weasley's reply. "You don't have
to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night
when I caught him. "
Ron hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Weasley
mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He
glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was
*241*
growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words
forming.
207
"Let me show you. "
Ron paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.
(40K.55
The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind,
stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open,
Ron saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have
turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly,
he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and
before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the
window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was
pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color
and shadow.
He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred
shapes around him came suddenly into focus.
He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the
sleeping portraits was Weasley's office - but it wasn't Weasley
who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald
except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by
candlelight. Ron had never seen this man before.
"I'm sorry," he said shakily. "I didn't mean to butt in -"
But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly.
Ron drew nearer to his desk and stammered, "Er - I'll just go, shall
I?"
Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him.
Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Ron raised his voice.
*242*
"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now," he half-shouted.
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past
Ron without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his
window.
208
The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset.
The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs,
watching the door.
Ron looked around the office. No Ron the phoenix - no whirring
silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Weasley had known it,
meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Weasley,
and he, Ron, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to
the people of fifty years ago.
There was a knock on the office door.
"Enter," said the old wizard in a feeble voice.
A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver
prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than
Ron, but he, too, had jet-black hair.
"Ah, Weasley," said the Headmaster.
"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?" said Weasley. He looked
nervous.
"Sit down," said Dippet. "I've just been reading the letter you sent me.
"Oh," said Weasley. He sat down, gripping his hands together very
tightly.
"My dear boy," said Dipper kindly, "I cannot possibly let you stay at
school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the
holidays?"
"No," said Weasley at once. "Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go
back to that - to that -"
* 243*
"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?" said
Dippet curiously.
"Yes, sir," said Weasley, reddening slightly.
209
"You are Muggle-born?"
"Half-blood, sir," said Weasley. "Muggle father, witch mother."
"And are both your parents -?"
"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the
orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Ron after my
father, Ron after my grandfather."
Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.
"The thing is, Ron," he sighed, "Special arrangements might have
been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . ."
"You mean all these attacks, sir?" said Weasley, and Ron's heart
leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.
"Precisely," said the headmaster. "My dear boy, you must see how
foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when
term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of
that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As
a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about
closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all
this unpleasantness . . . ."
Weasley's eyes had widened.
"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -"
"What do you mean?" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting
up in his chair. "Weasley, do you mean you know something about
these attacks?"
"No, sir," said Weasley quickly.
But Ron was sure it was the same sort of "no" that he himself had
given Weasley.
*244*
Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.
210
"You may go, Ron ......
Weasley slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Ron
followed him.
Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the
gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Weasley stopped, and so did
Ron, watching him. Ron could tell that Weasley was doing some
serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.
Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off,
Ron gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn't see another person
until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long,
sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Weasley from the marble
staircase.
"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Ron?"
Ron gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-yearyounger
Weasley.
"I had to see the headmaster, sir," said Weasley.
"Well, hurry off to bed," said Weasley, giving Weasley exactly the
kind of penetrating stare Ron knew so well. "Best not to roam the
corridors these days. Not since . . ."
He sighed heavily, bade Weasley good night, and strode off. Weasley
watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed
straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Ron in hot
pursuit.
But to Ron's disappointment, Weasley led him not into a hidden
passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which
Ron had Potions with Weasley. The torches hadn't been lit, and when
Weasley pushed the door almost closed, Ron could only just
*2 45 *
see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.
211
It felt to Ron that they were there for at least an hour. All he could
see was the figure of Weasley at the door, staring through the crack,
waiting like a statue. And just when Ron had stopped feeling
expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present,
he heard something move beyond the door.
Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was
pass the dungeon where he and Weasley were hidden. Weasley, quiet as a
shadow, edged through the door and followed, Ron tiptoeing behind
him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard.
For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Weasley
stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises.
Ron heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a
hoarse whisper.
"C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C'mon now ... in the box. . ."
There was something familiar about that voice ....
Weasley suddenly jumped around the corner. Ron stepped out behind
him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching
in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.
"Evening, Ron," said Weasley sharply.
The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.
"What yer doin' down here, Ron?"
Weasley stepped closer.
"It's all over," he said. "I'm going to have to turn you in, Ron.
They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop."
4 6
"N" at d'yeh -"
"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make
good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -"
212
"It never killed no one!" said the large boy, backing against the
closed door. From behind him, Ron could hear a funny rustling and
clicking.
"Come on, Ron," said Weasley, moving yet closer. "The dead girl's
parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make
sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......
"It wasn't him!" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark
passage. "He wouldn'! He never!"
"Rond aside," said Weasley, drawing out his wand.
His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind
the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall
opposite. And out of it came something that made Ron let out a
long, piercing scream unheard by anyone
A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of
many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Weasley raised his
wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it
scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Weasley
scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the
huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down,
yelling, "NO000000!"
The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Ron felt himself
falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster
in the Weasley dormitory, Weasley's diary lying open on his stomach.
*24 7*
Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door
opened and Ron came in.
"There you are," he said.
Ron sat up. He was sweating and shaking.
"What's up?" said Ron, looking at him with concern.
"It was Weasley, Ron. Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty
213
years ago."
Ron, Ron, and Ron had always known that Weasley had an
unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first
year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden
house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, threeheaded
dog he'd christened "Ron." And if, as a boy, Weasley had
heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Ron was
sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably
thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so
long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs;
Ron could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Weasley trying to fit a
leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Weasley would
never have meant to kill anybody.
Ron half wished he hadn't found out how to work Weasley's diary.
Again and again Ron and Ron made him recount what
he'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the
long, circular conversations that followed.
"Weasley might have got the wrong person," said Ron. "Maybe it
was some other monster that was attacking people . . . ."
"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?" Ron asked
dully.
"We always knew Weasley had been expelled," said Ron miserably.
"And the attacks must've stopped after Weasley was kicked out.
Otherwise, Weasley wouldn't have got his award."
Ron tried a different tack.
"Weasley does sound like Ron - who asked him to squeal on Weasley,
anyway?"
"But the monster had killed someone, Ron," said Ron.
"And Weasley was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they
closed Hogwarts," said Ron. "I don't blame him for wanting to stay
here ......
214
"You met Weasley down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Ron?"
"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent," said Ron quickly.
The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Ron voiced the
knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.
"Do you think we should go and ask Weasley about it all?"
"That'd be a cheerful visit," said Ron. "'Hello, Weasley. Tell us, have
you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"'
In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Weasley
unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by
with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became
hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had
been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Ron and Nearly
Headless Ron had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to
think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Ron
had finally got bored of his "Oh, Weasley, you rotter" song, Ron
Weasley asked Ron quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping
toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the
Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This
made Professor Weasley very happy.
"The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll
know they're fully mature," she told Ron. "Then we'll be able to
revive those poor people in the hospital wing."
The second years were given something new to think about during
their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for
the third year, a matter that Ron, at least, took very seriously.
"it could affect our whole future," she told Ron and Ron as they
pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.
"I just want to give up Potions," said Ron.
"We can't," said Ron gloomily. "We keep all our old subjects, or I'd've
ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts."
215
"But that's very important!" said Ron, shocked.
"Not the way Weasley teaches it," said Ron. "I haven't learned
anything from him except not to set pixies loose."
Ron Weasley had been sent letters from all the witches and
wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to
choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with
his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy
sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Ron
Ron, who, like Ron, had grown up with Muggles, ended up
closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the
subjects it landed on. Ron took nobody's advice but signed up for
everything.
Ron smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Ron
and Aunt Ron would say if he tried to discuss his career in
wizardry with them. Not that he didn't get any guidance: Ron
Weasley was eager to share his experience.
"Depends where you want to go, Ron," he said. "It's never too early
to think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. People say
Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should
have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community,
particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them -
look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My
brother Ron was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for
Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Ron."
But the only thing Ron felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In
the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was
lousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him.
Weasley's next Quidditch match would be against Weasley. Weasley
was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Ron
barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However,
the training sessions were getting better, or at least
drier, and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his
dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Weasley's chances for
the Quidditch cup had never been better.
216
But his cheerful mood didn't last long. At the top of the stairs to the
dormitory, he met Ron Weasley, who was looking frantic.
"Ron - I don't know who did it - I just found -"
Watching Ron fearfully, Ron pushed open the door.
The contents of Ron's trunk had been thrown everywhere. His
cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his
four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside
cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.
Ron walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few
loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Ron pulled the
blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Ron, and Ron came in. Ron
swore loudly.
"What happened, Ron?"
"No idea," said Ron. But Ron was examining Ron's robes. All the
pockets were hanging out.
"Someone's been looking for something," said Ron. "Is there anything
missing?"
Ron started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.
It was only as he threw the last of the Weasley books back into it
that he realized what wasn't there.
"Weasley's diary's gone," he said in an undertone to Ron.
"What?"
Ron jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed
him out. They hurried down to the Weasley common
room, which was half-empty, and joined Ron, who was sitting
alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.
Ron looked aghast at the news.
217
"But - only a Weasley could have stolen - nobody else knows our
password -"
"Exactly," said Ron.
They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing
breeze.
"Perfect Quidditch conditions!" said Weasley enthusiastically at the
Weasley table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs.
"Ron, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast."
Ron had been staring down the packed Weasley table, wondering
if the new owner of Weasley's diary was right in front of his eyes.
Ron had been urging him to report the robbery, but Ron didn't
like the idea. He'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how
many people knew why Weasley had been expelled fifty years ago? He
didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again.
As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Ron to go and collect his
Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Ron's
growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he
heard it yet again
"Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear. . ."
He shouted aloud and Ron and Ron both jumped away from him
in alarm.
"The voice!" said Ron, -looking over his shoulder. "I just heard it
again - didn't you?"
Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Ron, however, clapped a
hand to her forehead.
"Ron - I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the
library!"
And she sprinted away, up the stairs.
"What does she understand?" said Ron distractedly, still looking
around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.
218
"Loads more than I do," said Ron, shaking his head.
"But why's she got to go to the library?"
"Because that's what Ron does," said Ron, shrugging. "When in
doubt, go to the library."
Ron stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people
were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly,
exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.
"You'd better get moving," said Ron. "It's nearly eleven - the match -
"
Ron raced up to Weasley Tower, collected his Nimbus Two
Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds,
but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and
as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker. room, his only comfort
was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.
The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Ron
Weasley took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Ron
Weasley released the balls. The Weasleys, who played in canary
yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of
tactics.
Ron was just mounting his broom when Professor Weasley
came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an
enormous purple megaphone.
Ron's heart dropped like a stone.
"This match has been cancelled," Professor Weasley called
through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were
boos and shouts. Ron Weasley, looking devastated, landed and ran
toward Professor Weasley without getting off his broomstick.
"But, Professor!" he shouted. "We've got to play - the cup
Weasley -"
219
Professor Weasley ignored him and continued to shout through her
megaphone:
"All students are to make their way back to the House common
rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further
information. As quickly as you can, please!"
Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Ron over to her.
"Weasley, I think you'd better come with me ......
Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Ron saw
Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up
to them as they set off toward the castle. To Ron's surprise,
Professor Weasley didn't object.
"Yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, Weasley .....
Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about
the match being canceled; others looked worried. Ron and Ron
followed Professor Weasley back into the school and up the
marble staircase. But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time.
"This will be a bit of a shock," said Professor Weasley in a
surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. "There has
been another attack ... another double attack."
Ron's insides did a horrible somersault. Professor Weasley
pushed the door open and he and Ron entered. .
Ron Weasley was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly
hair. Ron recognized her as the Weasley they'd accidentally
asked for directions to the Weasley common room. And on the bed
next to her was
"Ron!" Ron groaned.
Ron lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.
"They were found near the library," said Professor Weasley. "I
don't suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next
to them ......
220
She was holding up a small, circular mirror.
Ron and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Ron.
"I will escort you back to Weasley Tower," said Professor
Weasley heavily. "I need to address the students in any case.
"All students will return to their House common rooms by six o'clock
in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time.
You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use
the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch
training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more
evening activities."
The Weasleys packed inside the common room listened to Professor
Weasley in silence. She rolled up the parchment
from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked
voice, "I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is
likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these
attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know
anything about them to come forward."
She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the
Weasleys began talking immediately.
"That's two Weasleys down, not counting a Weasley ghost, one
Weasley, and one Weasley, " said the Weasley twins' friend Ron
Weasley, counting on his fingers. "Haven't any of the teachers noticed
that the Weasleys are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming
from Weasley? The Heir of Weasley, the monster of Weasley - why
don't they just chuck all the Weasleys out?" he roared, to nods and
scattered applause.
Ron Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Ron, but for once he didn't
seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.
"Ron's in shock," Ron told Ron quietly. "That Weasley girl -
Ron Weasley - she's a prefect. I don't think he thought the
monster would dare attack a prefect."
221
But Ron was only half-listening. He didn't seem to be able to get rid
of the picture of Ron, lying on the hospital bed as though carved
out of stone. And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at a
lifetime back with the Weasleys. Ron Weasley had turned Weasley in
because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the
school closed. Ron now knew exactly how he had felt.
"What're we going to do?" said Ron quietly in Ron's ear. "D'you
think they suspect Weasley?"
"We've got to go and talk to him," said Ron, making up his
mind. "I can't believe it's him this time, but if he set the monster
loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets,
and that's a start."
"But Weasley said we've got to stay in our tower unless we're
in class -"
"I think," said Ron, more quietly still, "it's time to get my dad's
old cloak out again."
Ron had inherited) ust one thing from his father: a long and sil
very Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of
the school to visit Weasley without anyone knowing about it. They
went to bed at the usual time, waited until Ron, Ron, and Sea
mus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally
fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over
themselves.
The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors
wasn't enjoyable. Ron, who had wandered the castle at night sev
eral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teach
ers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs,
staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak
didn't stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly
tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot
where Weasley stood standing guard. Thankfully, Weasley sneezed at
almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they
reached the oak front doors and eased them open.
It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows
of Weasley's house and pulled off the cloak only when they were
right outside his front door.
Seconds after they had knocked, Weasley flung it open. They found
themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Ron
222
the boarhound barked loudly behind him.
"Oh," he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. "What're
you two doin' here?"
"What's that for?" said Ron, pointing at the crossbow as they
stepped inside.
"Nothin' - nothin' - " Weasley muttered. "I've bin expectin' doesn'
matter - Sit down - I'll make tea -"
He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly
extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then
smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.
"Are you okay, Weasley?" said Ron. "Did you hear about
Ron?"
"Oh, I heard, all righ'," said Weasley, a slight break in his voice.
He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both
large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and
was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud
knock on the door.
Weasley dropped the fruitcake. Ron and Ron exchanged
panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over
themselves and retreated into a corner. Weasley checked that they
were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once
more.
"Good evening, Weasley."
It was Weasley. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was
followed by a second, very odd-looking man.
The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and
was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a
scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm
he carried a lime-green bowler.
223
"That's Dad's boss!" Ron breathed. "Ron Weasley, the Minister of
Magic!"
Ron elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.
Weasley had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs
and looked from Weasley to Ron Weasley.
"Bad business, Weasley," said Weasley in rather clipped tones. "Very bad
business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone
far enough. Ministry's got to act."
"I never," said Weasley, looking imploringly at Weasley. "You know I
never, Professor Weasley, sir -"
"I want it understood, Ron, that Weasley has my full confidence,"
said Weasley, frowning at Weasley.
"Look, Ron," said Weasley, uncomfortably. "Weasley's record's against
him. Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been
in touch -"
"Yet again, Ron, I tell you that taking Weasley away will not help
in the slightest," said Weasley. His blue eyes were full of a fire
Ron had never seen before.
"Look at it from my point of view," said Weasley, fidgeting with his
bowler. "I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing
something. If it turns out it wasn't Weasley, he'll be back and no more
said. But I've got to take him. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty -"
"Take me?" said Weasley, who was trembling. "Take me where?"
"For a short stretch only," said Weasley, not meeting Weasley's eyes. "Not
a punishment, Weasley, more a precaution. If someone else is caught,
you'll be let out with a full apology -"
"Not Azkaban?" croaked Weasley.
Before Weasley could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.
224
Weasley answered it. It was Ron's turn for an elbow in the ribs;
he'd let out an audible gasp.
Mr. Ron Weasley strode into Weasley's hut, swathed in a long black
traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Ron started to
growl.
"Already here, Weasley," he said approvingly. "Good, good. . ."
"What're you doin' here?" said Weasley furiously. "Get outta my house!"
"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being
inside your - er - d'you call this a house?" said Ron Weasley, sneering
as he looked around the small cabin. "I simply called at the school and
was told that the headmaster was here."
"And what exactly did you want with me, Ron?" said Weasley.
He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.
"Dreadful thing, Weasley," said Weasley lazily, taking out a long roll
of parchment, "but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside.
This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it.
I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have
there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate,
there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what
an awful loss that would be to the school."
"Oh, now, see here, Ron," said Weasley, looking alarmed,
"Weasley suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now
262
"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for
the governors, Weasley," said Mr. Weasley smoothly. "And as
Weasley has failed to stop these attacks -"
"See here, Weasley, if Weasley can't stop them," said Weasley, whose
upper lip was sweating now, "I mean to say, who can?"
"That remains to be seen," said Mr. Weasley with a nasty smile. "But as
all twelve of us have voted -"
225
Weasley leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.
'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they
agreed, Weasley, eh?" he roared.
"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble
one of these days, Weasley," said Mr. Weasley. "I would advise you not
to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all."
"Yeh can' take Weasley!" yelled Weasley, making Ron the
boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. "Take him away, an' the
Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!"
"Calm yourself, Weasley," said Weasley sharply. He looked at
Ron Weasley.
"If the governors want my removal, Ron, I shall of course step aside
-"
"But -" stuttered Weasley.
"No!"growled Weasley.
Weasley had not taken his bright blue eyes off Ron Weasley's
cold gray ones.
"However," said Weasley, speaking very slowly and clearly so that
none of them could miss a word, "you will find that I will
* 26$*
ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake
alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into
bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Weasley visible from the castle
windows, striding the grounds with Ron at his heels, the scene didn't
look right to Ron; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle,
where things were so horribly wrong.
Ron and Ron had tried to visit Ron, but visitors were now
barred from the hospital wing.
226
"We're taking no more chances," Ron Weasley told them severely
through a crack in the infirmary door. "No, I'm sorry, there's every
chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . ."
With Weasley gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the
sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned
windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school
* 265*
that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through
the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.
Ron constantly repeated Weasley's final words to himself "I will
only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will
always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it." But what good
were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help,
when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?
Weasley's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the
trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to
follow. Ron looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly)
by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't
allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle
in a pack with the other Weasleys. Most of their fellow students
seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by
teachers, but Ron found it very irksome.
One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the
atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Ron Weasley was strutting
around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy.
Ron didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions
lesson about two weeks after Weasley and Weasley had left, when,
sitting right behind Weasley, Ron overheard him gloating to Weasley
and Weasley.
"I always thought Ronher might be the one who got rid of
Weasley," he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. "I told you
he thinks Weasley's the worst headmaster the school's ever
227
*266*
had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't
want the Chamber of Secrets closed. Weasley won't last long,
she's only filling in ......
Weasley swept past Ron, making no comment about Ron's
empty seat and cauldron.
"Sir," said Weasley loudly. "Sir, why don't you apply for the
headmaster's job?"
"Now, now, Weasley," said Weasley, though he couldn't suppress a thinlipped
smile. "Professor Weasley has only been suspended by the
governors. I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough."
"Yeah, right," said Weasley, smirking. "I expect you'd have Ronher's
vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Ronher you're the
best teacher here, sir -"
Weasley smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not
spotting Ron Weasley, who was pretending to vomit into his
cauldron.
"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by
now," Weasley went on. "Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity
it wasn't Weasley -"
The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Weasley's last
words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags
and books, his attempts to reach Weasley went unnoticed.
"Let me at him," Ron growled as Ron and Ron hung onto his arms.
"I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare
hands -"
"Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology," barked Weasley over
the class's heads, and off they marched, with Ron, Ron, and Ron
bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only
* 261*
228
safe to let go of him when Weasley had seen them out of the castle and
they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the
greenhouses.
The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing
from their number, Ron and Ron.
Professor Weasley set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian
Shrivelfigs. Ron went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the
compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ron Weasley.
Ron took a deep breath and said, very formally, "I just want to say,
Ron, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. I know you'd never attack
Ron Weasley, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We're all in
the same boat now, and, well -"
He held out a pudgy hand, and Ron shook it.
Ron and his friend Ron came to work at the same Shrivelfig as
Ron and Ron.
"That Ron Weasley character," said Ron, breaking off dead twigs,
"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? D'you know, I think
he might be Weasley's heir."
"That's clever of you," said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven
Ron as readily as Ron.
"Do you think it's Weasley, Ron?" Ron asked.
"No," said Ron, so firmly that Ron and Ron stared.
A second later, Ron spotted something.
Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side
of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the
shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Ron hit Ron over the hand
with his pruning shears.
"Ouch! What're you -"
268
229
Ron pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes
screwed up against the sun.
"Oh, yeah," said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. "But we can't
follow them now -"
Ron and Ron were listening curiously.
Ron's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued
their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would
end up.
"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . ."
And Ron looked even unhappier about that.
At the end of the lesson Professor Weasley escorted the class to their
Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Ron and Ron lagged behind
the others so they could talk out of earshot.
"We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again," Ron told Ron. "We
can take Ron with us. He's used to going into the forest with Weasley,
he might be some help."
"Right," said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers.
"Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the
forest?" he added as they took their usual places at the back of
Weasley's classroom.
Preferring not to answer that question, Ron said, "There are good
things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...
Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Ron had
entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.
Weasley bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every
other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but
Weasley appeared nothing short of buoyant.
2 69
"Come now," he cried, beaming around him. "Why all these long
230
faces?"
People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.
"Don't you people realize," said Weasley, speaking slowly, as though
they were all a bit dim, "the danger has passed! The culprit has been
taken away -"
"Says who?" said Ron Ron loudly.
"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken
Weasley if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,"
said Weasley, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one
made two.
"Oh, yes he would," said Ron, even more loudly than Ron.
"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Weasley's arrest than you
do, Mr. Weasley," said Weasley in a self-satisfied tone.
Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in
midsentence when Ron kicked him hard under the desk.
"We weren't there, remember?" Ron muttered.
But Weasley's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always
thought Weasley was no good, his confidence that the whole business
was now at an end, irritated Ron so much that he yearned to throw
Gadding with Ghouls right in Weasley's stupid face. Instead he
contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight.
Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the
empty seat usually filled by Ron. The sight seemed to stiffen his
resolve, and he nodded.
The Weasley common room was always very crowded these days,
because from six o'clock onward the Weasleys had no -
*270*
where else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result
that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight.
231
Ron went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after
dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to
clear. Ron and Ron challenged Ron and Ron to a few games of
Exploding Snap, and Ron sat watching them, very subdued in
Ron's usual chair. Ron and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying
to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight
when Ron, Ron, and Ron finally went to bed.
Ron and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors
closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and
climbing through the portrait hole.
It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the
teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on
the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any
creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.
"'Course," said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass,
"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those
spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they
were moving in that sort of general direction, but. . ."
His voice trailed away hopefully.
They reached Weasley's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank
windows. When Ron pushed the door open, Ron went mad with joy
at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle
with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from
a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.
Ron left the Invisibility Cloak on Weasley's table. There would be no
need for it in the pitch-dark forest.
* 21:L *
"C'mon, Ron, we're going for a walk," said Ron, patting his leg, and
Ron bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the
edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.
Ron took out his wand, murmured, "Lumos!" and a tiny light
appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for
232
signs of spiders.
"Good thinking," said Ron. "Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd
probably blow up or something ......
Ron tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary
spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the
trees.
"Okay," Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, "I'm ready. Let's
go."
So, with Ron scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves,
they entered the forest. By the glow of Ron's wand, they followed
the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked
behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for
noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the
trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were
no longer visible, and Ron's wand shone alone in the sea of dark,
they saw their spider guides leaving the path.
Ron paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but
everything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had
never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly
remember Weasley advising him not to leave the forest path last time
he'd been in here. But Weasley was miles away now, probably sitting in
a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.
* 2-V2 *
Something wet touched Ron's hand and he jumped backward,
crushing Rods foot, but it was only Ron's nose.
"What d'you reckon?" Ron said to Ron, whose eyes he could just
make out, reflecting the light from his wand.
"We've come this far," said Ron.
So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees.
They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and
stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Ron could
feel Ron's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop,
233
so that Ron could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.
They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes
snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they
noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the
trees were as thick as ever.
Then Ron suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Ron
and Ron jump out of their skins.
"What?" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and
gripping Ron's elbow very hard.
"There's something moving over there," Ron breathed. "Listen ...
sounds like something big ......
They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was
snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.
"Oh, no," said Ron. "Oh, no, oh, no, oh -"
"Shut up," said Ron frantically. "It'll hear you."
"Hear me?" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. "It's already heard
Ron!"
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they
* 273*
stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then
silence.
"What d'you think it's doing?" said Ron.
"Probably getting ready to pounce," said Ron.
They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.
"D'you think it's gone?" Ron whispered.
"Dunno -"
234
Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the
darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes.
Ron yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and
yelped even louder.
"Ron!" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief "Ron, it's our
car!"
"What?"
"Come on!"
Ron blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping,
and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.
Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of
thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As
Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him,
exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.
"It's been here all the time!" said Ron delightedly, walking around the
car. "Look at it. The forest's turned it wild . . . ."
The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud.
Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own.
Ron didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Ron, who could
feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Ron stuffed
his wand back into his robes.
*214*
"And we thought it was going to attack us!" said Ron, leaning against
the car and patting it. "I wondered where it had gone!"
Ron squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders,
but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.
"We've lost the trail," he said. "C'mon, let's go and find them."
Ron didn't speak. He didn't move. His eyes were fixed on a point
some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Ron. His face was
235
livid with terror.
Ron didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking
noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around
the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging
facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's
legs leave the ground, too, heard Ron whimpering and howling - next
moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.
Head hanging, Ron saw that what had hold of him was marching on
six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below
a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of
the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very
heart of the forest. Ron could hear Ron fighting to free himself from
a third monster, whining loudly, but Ron couldn't have yelled even if
he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car
in the clearing.
He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only
knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the
leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck
sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of
*21$*
a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars
shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.
Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below.
Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy,
gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Ron made its way
down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of
the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their
pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.
Ron fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron
and Ron thudded down next to him. Ron wasn't howling anymore,
but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Ron felt.
His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes
were popping.
Ron suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was
236
saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his
pincers with every word he spoke.
"Ron!" it called. "Ron!"
And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a
small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of
his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was
milky white. He was blind.
"What is it?" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
"Men," clicked the spider who had caught Ron.
"Is it Weasley?" said Ron, moving closer, his eight milky eyes
wandering vaguely.
"Strangers," clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
"Kill them," clicked Ron fretfully. "I was sleeping ......
"We're friends of Weasley's," Ron shouted. His heart seemed to have
left his chest to pound in his throat.
*216*
Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.
Ron paused.
"Weasley has never sent men into our hollow before," he said slowly.
"Weasley's in trouble," said Ron, breathing very fast. "That's why
we've come."
"In trouble?" said the aged spider, and Ron thought he heard concern
beneath the clicking pincers. "But why has he sent you?"
Ron thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn't
think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as
calmly as he could.
237
"They think,, up at the school, that Weasley's been setting a a -
something on students. They've taken him to Azkaban."
Ron clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the
sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause,
except applause didn't usually make Ron feel sick with fear.
"But that was years ago," said Ron fretfully. "Years and years ago.
I remember it well. That's why they made him leave the school. They
believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the
Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Weasley had opened the
Chamber and set me free."
"And you ... you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets?" said
Ron, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.
"I!" said Ron, clicking angrily. "I was not born in the castle. I come
from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Weasley when I was an egg.
Weasley was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in
the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Weasley
2Y
is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and
blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in
the forest ever since, where Weasley still visits me. He even found me
a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through
Weasley's goodness ......
Ron summoned what remained of his courage.
"So you never - never attacked anyone?"
"Never," croaked the old spider. "It would have been my instinct, but
out of respect for Weasley, I never harmed a human. The body of the
girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any
part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like
the dark and the quiet ......
"But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl?" said Ron.
"Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again -"
238
His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the
rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted
all around him.
"The thing that lives in the castle," said Ron, "is an ancient creature
we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded
with Weasley to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the
school."
"What is it?" said Ron urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
"We do not speak of it!" said Ron fiercely. "We do not name it! I
never even told Weasley the name of that dread creature, though he
asked me, many times."
Ron didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders
* 2-V8 *
pressing closer on all sides. Ron seemed to be tired of tamng. He
was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders
continued to inch slowly toward Ron and Ron.
"We'll just go, then," Ron called desperately to Ron, hearing
leaves rustling behind him.
"Go?" said Ron slowly. "I think not ......
"But - but -"
"My sons and daughters do not harm Weasley, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our
midst. Good-bye, friend of Weasley."
Ron spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall
of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.
Even as he reached for his wand, Ron knew it was no good, there
were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting,
a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the
239
hollow.
Mr. Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring,
its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto
their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to
a halt in front of Ron and Ron and the doors flew open.
"Get Ron!" Ron yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the
boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of
the car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn't touch the accelerator
but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off,
hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and
they were soon crashing through the forest, branches
whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the
widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.
Ron looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent
scream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore.
"Are you okay?"
Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak.
They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Ron howling loudly
in the back seat, and Ron saw the side mirror snap off as they
squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees
thinned, and Ron could again see patches of sky.
The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the
windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Ron flung
himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Ron
opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Weasley's house, tail
between his legs. Ron got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron
seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked
and staring. Ron gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into
the forest and disappeared from view.
Ron went back into Weasley's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Ron
was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Ron got outside
again, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.
240
"Follow the spiders," said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve.
"I'll never forgive Weasley. We're lucky to be alive."
"I bet he thought Ron wouldn't hurt friends of his," said Ron.
"That's exactly Weasley's problem!" said Ron, thumping the wall of the
cabin. "He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're
*280*
made out, and look where it's got him! A cell in Azkaban!" He was
shivering uncontrollably now. "What was the point of sending us in
there? What have we found out, Id like to know?"
"That Weasley never opened the Chamber of Secrets," said Ron,
throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him
walk. "He was innocent."
Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Ron in a cupboard
wasn't his idea of being innocent.
As the castle loomed nearer Ron twitched the cloak to make sure
their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar.
They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the
marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where
watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the
Weasley common room, where the fire had burned itself into
glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to
their dormitory.
Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Ron,
however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter,
thinking hard about everything Ron had said.
The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought,
sounded like a sort of monster Weasley - even other monsters didn't
want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it
was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Weasley had never known
what was in the Chamber of Secrets.
Ron swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his
pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.
241
He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends
*281*
everywhere. Weasley had caught the wrong person, the Heir of
Weasley had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same
person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time.
There was nobody else to ask. Ron lay down, still thinking about
what Ron had said.
He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last
hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.
"Ron," he hissed through the dark, "Ron -"
Ron woke with a yelp like Ron's, stared wildly around, and saw
Ron.
"Ron -that girl who died. Ron said she was found in a bathroom,"
said Ron, ignoring Ron's snufing snores from the corner. "What
if she never left the bathroom? What if she's still there?"
Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he
understood, too.
"You don't think - not Moaning Ron?"
A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just
three toilets away," said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,
"and we could've asked her, and now. . ."
It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their
teachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom,
moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be
almost impossible.
But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove
the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks.
Ten minutes into the class, Professor Weasley told them that their
exams would start on the first of June, one week from today.
242
`Exams?" howled Ron Weasley. "We're still getting exams?"
There was a loud bang behind Ron as Ron Weasley's wand
slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr
*28%*
Weasley restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned,
frowning, to Ron.
"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to
receive your education," she said sternly. "The exams will therefore
take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard."
Studying hard! It had never occurred to Ron that there would be
exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous
muttering around the room, which made Professor Weasley scowl
even more darkly.
"Professor Weasley's instructions were to keep the school running
as normally as possible, she said. "And that, I need hardly point out,
means finding out how much you have learned this year.
Ron looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be
turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn't
seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.
Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in the
Forbidden Forest.
"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?" he asked Ron, holding
up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.
Three days before their first exam, Professor Weasley made
another announcement at breakfast.
"I have good news," she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling
silent, erupted.
243
"Weasley's coming back!" several people yelled joyfully.
"You've caught the Heir of Weasley!" squealed a girl at the
Weasley table.
284*
"Quidditch matches are back on!" roared Weasley excitedly.
When the hubbub had subsided, Professor Weasley said,
"Professor Weasley has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for
cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who
have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may
well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that
this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit."
There was an explosion of cheering. Ron looked over at the
Weasley table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Ron Weasley
hadn't joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he'd looked in
days.
"It won't matter that we never asked Ron, then!" he said to Ron.
"Ron'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up!
Mind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in three
days' time. She hasn't studied. It might be kinder to leave her where
she is till they're over."
Just then, Ron Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She
looked tense and nervous, and Ron noticed that her hands were
twisting in her lap.
"What's up?" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.
Ron didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Weasley
table with a scared look on her face that reminded Ron of someone,
though he couldn't think who.
"Spit it out," said Ron, watching her.
Ron suddenly realized who Ron looked like. She was rocking
backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Ron did
when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.
244
"I've got to tell you something," Ron mumbled, carefully not looking at
Ron.
"What is it?" said Ron.
Ron looked as though she couldn't find the right words.
"What?"said Ron.
Ron opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Ron leaned
forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ron and Ron could hear him.
"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen
something? Someone acting oddly?"
Ron drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Ron Weasley
appeared, looking tired and wan.
"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ron. I'm starving, I've
only just come off patrol duty."
Ron jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave
Ron a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Ron sat
down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.
"Ron!" said Ron angrily. "She was just about to tell us some-' thing
important!"
Halfway through a gulp of tea, Ron choked.
"What sort of thing?" he said, coughing.
"I just asked her if she'd seen anything odd, and she started to say
"Oh - that - that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets," said
Ron at once.
"How do you know?" said Ron, his eyebrows raised.
"Well, er, if you must know, Ron, er, walked in on me the other day
when I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spot
245
ted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to
anybody. I must say, I did think she'd keep her word. It's nothing,
really, Id just rather -"
Ron had never seen Ron look so uncomfortable.
"What were you doing, Ron?" said Ron, grinning. "Go on, tell us, we
won't laugh."
Ron didn't smile back.
"Pass me those rolls, Ron, I'm starving."
Ron knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without
their help, but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Ron
if it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were
being led to History of Magic by Ron Weasley.
Weasley, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed,
only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly
convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely
down the corridors. His hair wasn't as sleek as usual; it seemed he
had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.
"Mark my words," he said, ushering them around a corner. "The first
words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It was
Weasley.' Ronly, I'm astounded Professor Weasley thinks all
these security measures are necessary."
(ti agree, sir," said Ron, making Ron drop his books in surprise.
"Thank you, Ron, said Weasley graciously while they waited for a
long line of Weasleys to pass. "I mean, we teachers have quite
enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and
standing guard all night ......
"That's right," said Ron, catching on. "Why don't you leave us here, sir,
we've only got one more corridor to go -"
"You know, Weasley, I think I will," said Weasley. "I really should go
and prepare my next class -"
246
And he hurried off.
"Prepare his class," Ron sneered after him. "Gone to curl his hair,
more like."
They let the rest of the Weasleys draw ahead of them, then darted
down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Ron's
bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their
brilliant scheme
"Weasley! Weasley! What are you doing?"
It was Professor Weasley, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin
lines.
"We were -we were-" Ron stammered. "We were going to - to go and
see -"
"Ron," said Ron. Ron and Professor Weasley both looked
at him.
"We haven't seen her for ages, Professor," Ron went on hurriedly,
treading on Ron's foot, "and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital
wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er,
not to worry -"
Professor Weasley was still staring at him, and for a moment,
Ron thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in
a strangely croaky voice.
"Of course," she said, and Ron, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her
beady eye. "Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends
of those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes,
Weasley, of course you may visit Miss Weasley. I will inform Professor
Weasley where you've gone. Tell Ron Weasley I have given my
permission."
Ron and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'd
avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard
Professor Weasley blow her nose.
247
"That," said Ron fervently, "was the best story you've ever come up
with."
They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Ron
Weasley that they had Professor Weasley's permission to visit
Ron.
Ron Weasley let them in, but reluctantly.
"There's just no point talking to a Petrified. person," she said, and they
had to admit she had a point when they'd taken their seats next to
Ron. It was plain that Ron didn't have the faintest inkling
that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside
cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.
"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?" said Ron, looking sadly
at Ron's rigid face. "Because if he sneaked up on them all, no
one'll ever know . .....
But Ron wasn't looking at Ron's face. He was more interested
in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending
closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.
Making sure that Ron Weasley was nowhere near, he pointed this
out to Ron.
"TG and get it out," Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he
blocked Ron from Ron Weasley's view.
It was no easy task. Ron's hand was clamped so tightly around
the paper that Ron was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept
watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes,
the paper came free.
It was a page torn from a very old library book. Ron smoothed it out
eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.
Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land,
there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk,
known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may
reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born
248
from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are
most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk
has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall
suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal
enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is
fatal to it.
And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Ron
recognized as Ron's. Pipes.
It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.
"Ron," he breathed. "This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the
Chamber's a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I've been hearing
that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It's because
I understand Parseltongue . . . ."
Ron looked up at the beds around him.
"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one's died -
because no one looked it straight in the eye. Ron saw it through his
camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Ron just got
Petrified. Ron . . . Ron must've seen the basilisk through Nearly
Headless Ron! Ron got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again .
. . and Ron and that Weasley prefect were found with a
mirror next to them. Ron had just realized the monster was a
basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to
look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her
mirror - and -"
Rods jaw had dropped.
"And Mrs. Norris?" he whispered eagerly.
Ron thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.
"The water. . ." he said slowly. "The flood from Moaning Ron's
bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection . . . ."
He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it,
the more it made sense.
249
`: . . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it"! he read aloud. "Weasley's
roosters were killed! The Heir of Weasley didn't want one anywhere
near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spidersflee before it.! It
all fits!"
"But how's the basilisk been getting around the place?" said Ron. "A
giant snake . . . Someone would've seen. . ."
Ron, however, pointed at the word Ron had scribbled at the
foot of the page.
"Pipes," he said. "Pipes . . . Ron, it's been using the plumbing. I've
been hearing that voice inside the walls . . . ."
291*
Ron suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.
"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!" he said hoarsely.
"What if it's a bathroom? What if it's in -"
`= Moaning Ron's bathroom, "said Ron.
They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able
to believe it.
"This means," said Ron, "I can't be the only Parselmouth in
the school. The Heir of Weasley's one, too. That's how he's been
controlling the basilisk."
"What're we going to do?" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing.
"Should we go straight to Weasley?"
"Let's go to the staff room," said Ron, jumping up. "She'll be
there in ten minutes. It's nearly break."
They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging
around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted
staff room. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs.
Ron and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.
But the bell to signal break never came.
Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon
agall's voice, magically magnified.
`All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teach
ers return to the staff room. Immediately, please. "
Ron wheeled around to stare at Ron.
"Not another attack? Not now?"
250
"What'll we do?" said Ron, aghast. "Go back to the dormitory?"
"No," said Ron, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of
wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers' cloaks. "In here. Let's hear
what it's all about. Then we can tell them what we've found out."
They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of
people moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open.
From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the
teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled,
others downright scared. Then Professor Weasley arrived.
"It has happened," she told the silent staff room. "A student has been
taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself."
Professor Weasley let out a squeal. Professor Weasley clapped her
hands over her mouth. Weasley gripped the back of a chair very hard
and said, "How can you be sure?"
"The Heir of Weasley," said Professor Weasley, who was very
white, "left another message. Right underneath the first one. `Her
skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. "'
Professor Weasley burst into tears.
"Who is it?" said Ron Weasley, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a
chair. "Which student?"
"Ron Weasley," said Professor Weasley.
Ron felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside
him.
"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow," said
Professor Weasley. "This is the end of Hogwarts. Weasley
always said. . ."
The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment,
Ron was sure it would be Weasley. But it was Weasley, and
he was beaming.
"So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?"
251
He didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him
with something remarkably like hatred. Weasley stepped forward.
"Just the man," he said. "The very man. A girl has been snatched by
the monster, Weasley. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your
moment has come at last."
Weasley blanched.
"That's right, Ron," chipped in Professor Weasley. "Weren't you
saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to
the Chamber of Secrets is?"
"I - well, I -"sputtered Weasley.
"Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?"
piped up Professor Weasley.
"D-did I? I don't recall -"
"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a
crack at the monster before Weasley was arrested," said Weasley. "Didn't
you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should
have been given a free rein from the first?"
Weasley stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.
"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -"
"We'll leave it to you, then, Ron," said Professor Weasley.
"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We'll make sure everyone's
out of your way. You'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. A
free rein at last."
Weasley gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the
rescue. He didn't look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was
trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked
weak-chinned and feeble.
"V very well," he said. "I'll - I'll be in my office, getting getting ready."
And he left the room.
252
"Right," said Professor Weasley, whose nostrils were flared,
"that's got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should
go and inform their students what has happened. Tell them the
Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the
rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their
dormitories."
The teachers rose and left, one by one.
It was probably the worst day of Ron's entire life. He, Ron, Ron,
and Ron sat together in a corner of the Weasley common room,
unable to say anything to each other. Ron wasn't there. He had gone
to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his
dormitory.
No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Weasley
Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Ron and
Ron went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.
"She knew something, Ron," said Ron, speaking for the first time
since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. "That's why
she was taken. It wasn't some stupid thing about Ron at all., She'd
found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why
she was -" Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. "I mean, she was a pureblood.
There can't be any other reason."
Ron could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was
the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do.
Anything.
"Ron" said Ron. "D'you think there's any chance at all she's not - you
know ="
Ron didn't know what to say. He couldn't see how Ron could still
be alive.
"D'you know what?" said Ron. "I think we should go and see
*295*
253
Weasley. Tell him what we know. He's going to try and get into the
Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's a
basilisk in there."
Because Ron couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he
wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Weasleys around
them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that
nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left
through the portrait hole.
Darkness was falling as they walked down to Weasley's office.
There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear
scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.
Ron knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the
door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Weasley's eyes
peering through it.
"Oh - Mr. Weasley - Mr. Weasley -" he said, opening the door a bit
wider. "I'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -"
"Professor, we've got some information for you," said Ron. "We
think it'll help you."
"Er - well - it's not terribly -" The side of Weasley's face that they
could see looked very uncomfortable. "I mean - well all right -"
He opened the door and they entered.
His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks
stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, had
been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into
the other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now
crammed into boxes on the desk.
*296*
"Are you going somewhere?" said Ron.
"Er, well, yes," said Weasley, ripping a life-size poster of himself from
the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. "Urgent call -
unavoidable - got to go -"
254
"What about my sister?" said Ron jerkily.
"Well, as to that - most unfortunate -" said Weasley, avoiding their
eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents
into a bag. "No one regrets more than I -"
"You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!" said Ron.
"You can't go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!"
"Well - I must say - when I took the job -" Weasley muttered, now
piling socks on top of his robes. "nothing in the job description - didn't
expect -"
"You mean you're running away?" said Ron disbelievingly. "After all
that stuff you did in your books -"
"Books can be misleading," said Weasley delicately.
"You wrote them!" Ron shouted.
"My dear boy," said Weasley, straightening up and frowning at Ron.
"Do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as
well if people didn't think Id done all those things. No one wants to
read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a
village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No
dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee
had a harelip. I mean, come on -"
"So you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people have
done?" said Ron incredulously.
"Ron, Ron," said Weasley, shaking his head impatiently, "it's not
nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had
*297*
to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to
do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they
wouldn't remember doing it. If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's
my Memory Charms. No, it's been a lot of work, Ron. It's not all
book signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you
255
have to be prepared for a long hard slog."
He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.
"Let's see," he said. "I think that's everything. Yes. Only one thing
left."
He pulled out his wand and turned to them.
"Awfully sorry, boys, but I'll have to put a Memory Charm on you
now. Can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. Id never
sell another book -"
Ron reached his wand just in time. Weasley had barely raised his,
when Ron bellowed, "Expelliarmus!"
Weasley was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew
high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.
"Shouldn't have let Professor Weasley teach us that one," said Ron
furiously, kicking Weasley's trunk aside. Weasley was looking up at
him, feeble once more. Ron was still pointing his wand at him.
"What d'you want me to do?" said Weasley weakly. "I don't know
where the Chamber of Secrets is. There's nothing I can do."
"You're in luck," said Ron, forcing Weasley to his feet at wandpoint.
"We think we know where it is. And what's inside it. Let's go."
*298*
They marched Weasley out of his office and down the nearest stairs,
along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the
door of Moaning Ron's bathroom.
They sent Weasley in first. Ron was pleased to see that he was
shaking.
Moaning Ron was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.
"Oh, it's you," she said when she saw Ron. "What do you want this
time?"
256
"To ask you how you died," said Ron.
Ron's whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had
never been asked such a flattering question.
"Ooooh, it was dreadful," she said with relish. "It happened right in
here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. Id hidden because
Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked,
and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said
something funny. A different language, I think it must have been.
Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I
unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -"
Ron swelled importantly, her face shining. "I died."
"How?" said Ron.
"No idea," said Ron in hushed tones. "I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I
was floating away . . . ." She looked dreamily at Ron. "And then I
came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see.
Oh, she was sorry she'd ever laughed at my glasses."
"Where exactly did you see the eyes?" said Ron.
*299*
"Somewhere there," said Ron, pointing vaguely toward the sink in
front of her toilet.
Ron and Ron hurried over to it. Weasley was standing well back, a
look of utter terror on his face.
It looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside
and out, including the pipes below. And then Ron saw it: Scratched
on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.
"That tap's never worked," said Ron brightly as he tried to turn it.
"Ron," said Ron. "Say something. Something in Parseltongue."
"But -" Ron thought hard. The only times he'd ever managed to
257
speak Parseltongue were when he'd been faced with a real snake. He
stared hard at the tiny- engraving, trying to imagine it was real.
"Open up," he said.
He looked at Ron, who shook his head.
"English," he said.
Ron looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.
If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were
moving.
"Open up," he said.
Except that the words weren't what he heard; a strange hissing had
escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and
began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact,
sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide
enough for a man to slide into.
Ron heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind
what he was going to do.
*300*
"I'm going down there," he said. .
He couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to the
Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance
that Ron might be alive.
"Me too," said Ron.
There was a pause.
"Well, you hardly seem to need me," said Weasley, with a shadow
of his old smile. "I'll just -"
He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Ron both pointed
their wands at him.
258
"You can go first," Ron snarled.
White-faced and wandless, Weasley approached the opening.
"Boys," he said, his voice feeble. "Boys, what good will it do?"
Ron jabbed him in the back with his wand. Weasley slid his legs
into the pipe.
"I really don't think -" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push,
and he slid out of sight. Ron followed quickly. He lowered himself
slowly into the pipe, then let go.
It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see
more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs,
which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew
that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons.
Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.
And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen
when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the
end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel
large enough to stand in. Weasley was getting to his
*301
feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Ron
stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.
"We must be miles under the school," said Ron, his voice echoing in
the black tunnel.
"Under the lake, probably," said Ron, squinting around at the dark,
slimy walls.
All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.
"Lumos!" Ron muttered to his wand and it lit again. "C'mon," he
said to Ron and Weasley, and off they went, their footsteps slapping
loudly on the wet floor.
The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.
259
Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.
"Remember," Ron said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,
"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . .....
But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound
they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be
a rat's skull. Ron lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that
it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to
imagine what Ron might look like if they found her, Ron led the
way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.
"Ron - there's something up there -" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing
Ron's shoulder.
They froze, watching. Ron could just see the outline of something
huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving.
"Maybe it's asleep," he breathed, glancing back at the other two.
Weasley's hands were pressed over his eyes. Ron turned back to
look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.
* 302 *
Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see,
Ron edged forward, his wand held high.
The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green,
lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had
shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.
"Blimey," said Ron weakly.
There was a sudden movement behind them. Ron Weasley's
knees had given way.
"Get up," said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Weasley.
Weasley got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the
ground.
Ron jumped forward, but too late - Weasley was straightening up,
260
panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his
face.
"The adventure ends here, boys!" he said. "I shall take a bit of this
skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl,
and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her
mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!"
He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled,
"Obliviate!"
The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Ron flung his
arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out
of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to
the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall
of broken rock.
"Ron!" he shouted. "Are you okay? Ron!"
"I'm here!" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. "I'm
okay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand ='
*303*
There was a dull thud and a loud "ow!" It sounded as though Ron had
just kicked Weasley in the shins.
"What now?" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. "We can't get
through - it'll take ages ......
Ron looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it.
He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by
magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole
tunnel caved in?
There was another thud and another "ow!" from behind the rocks.
They were wasting time. Ron had already been in the Chamber of
Secrets for hours .... Ron knew there was only one thing to do.
"Wait there," he called to Ron. "Wait with Weasley. I'll go on.... If I'm
not back in an hour. . .
261
There was a very pregnant pause,
"I'll try and shift some of this rock," said Ron, who seemed to be trying
to keep his voice steady. "So you can - can get back through. And,
Ron -"
"See you in a bit," said Ron, trying to inject some confidence into his
shaking voice.
And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.
Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone.
The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Ron's body was
tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what
he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another
bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were
carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.
*304*
Ron approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend
these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.
He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the
emerald eyes seemed to flicker.
"Open, "said Ron, in a low, faint hiss.
The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly
out of sight, and Ron, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.
e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering
stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a
ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd,
greenish gloom that filled the place.
His heart beating very fast, Ron stood listening to the chill silence.
Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And
where was Ron?
He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine
columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls.
262
He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest
sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes
seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the
stomach, he thought he saw one stir.
Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the
Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.
*306*
Ron had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It
was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to
the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two
enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between
the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red
hair.
"tinny!" Ron muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees.
"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -" He flung his wand
aside, grabbed Ron's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was
white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't
Petrified. But then she must be
"Ron, please wake up," Ron muttered desperately, shaking her.
Ron's head lolled hopelessly from side to side.
"She won't wake," said a soft voice.
Ron jumped and spun around on his knees.
A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar,
watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though
Ron were looking at him through a misted window. But there was
no mistaking him
"Ron - Ron Weasley?"
Weasley nodded, not taking his eyes off Ron's face.
"What d'you mean, she won't wake?" Ron said desperately. "She's
263
not - she's not -?"
"She's still alive," said Weasley. "But only just."
Ron stared at him. Ron Weasley had been at Hogwarts fifty years
ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day
older than sixteen.
"Are you a ghost?" Ron said uncertainly.
* 30 7*
"A memory," said Weasley quietly. "Preserved in a diary for fifty years.
He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open
there was the little black diary Ron had found in Moaning Ron's
bathroom. For a second, Ron wondered how it had got there - but
there were more pressing matters to deal with.
"You've got to help me, Ron," Ron said, raising Ron's head again.
"We've got to get her out of here. There's a basilisk ... I don't know
where it is, but it could be along any moment .... Please, help me -1)
Weasley didn't move. Ron, sweating, managed to hoist Ron half off
the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.
But his wand had gone.
"Did you see -?"
He looked up. Weasley was still watching him - twirling Ron's wand
between his long fingers.
"Thanks," said Ron, stretching out his hand for it.
A smile curled the corners of Weasley's mouth. He continued to stare at
Ron, twirling the wand idly.
"Listen," said Ron urgently, his knees sagging with Ron's dead
weight. "We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -"
"It won't come until it is called," said Weasley calmly.
264
Ron lowered Ron back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any
longer.
"What d'you mean?" he said. "Look, give me my wand, I might need it
-"
Weasley's smile broadened.
"You won't be needing it," he said.
*%08*
Ron stared at him.
"What d'you mean, I won't be -?"
"I've waited a long time for this, Ron Weasley," said Weasley. "For the
chance to see you. To speak to you."
"Look," said Ron, losing patience, "I don't think you get it. We're in
the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -"
"We're going to talk now," said Weasley, still smiling broadly, and he
pocketed Ron's wand.
Ron stared at him. There was something very funny going on here
....
"How did Ron get like this?" he asked slowly.
"Well, that's an interesting question," said Weasley pleasantly. "And quite
a long story. I suppose the real reason Ron Weasley's like this is
because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible
stranger."
"What are you talking about?" said Ron.
"The diary," said Weasley. `My diary. Little Ron's been writing in it for
months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how
her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with
secondhand robes and books, how" -Weasley's eyes glinted "how she
265
didn't think famous, good, great Ron Weasley would ever like her . . . ."
All the time he spoke, Weasley's eyes never left Ron's face. There
was an almost hungry look in them.
"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an elevenyear-
old girl," he went on. "But I was patient. I wrote back. I was
sympathetic, I was kind. Ron simply loved me. No one's ever
understood me like you, Ron .... I'm so glad I've got this diary to
*309*
confide in .... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .
Weasley laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs
stand up on the back of Ron's neck.
"If I say it myself, Ron, I've always been able to charm the people I
needed. So Ron poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to
be exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of
her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more
powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding
Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul
back into her. . ."
"What d'you mean?" said Ron, whose mouth had gone very dry.
" Haven't you guessed yet, Ron Weasley?" said Weasley softly. "Ron
Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school
roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the
Serpent of Weasley on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat.
"No," Ron whispered.
"Yes," said Weasley, calmly. "Of course, she didn't know what she was
doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her
new diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Ron,"
he recited, watching Ron's horrified face, `I think I'm losing my
memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how
they got there. Dear Ron, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of
Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front.
Dear Ron, Ron keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. I think he
266
suspects me... There was another attack today
*310
and I don't know where I was. Ron, what am I going to do? I think I'm
going mad... I think I'm the one attacking everyone, Ron!"
Ron's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his Palms.
"it took a very long time for stupid little Ron to stop trusting her
diary," said Weasley. "But she finally became suspicious and tried to
dispose of it. And that's where you came in, Ron. You found it, and I
couldn't have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have
picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . .
. ."
"And why did you want to meet me?" said Ron. Anger was coursing
through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.
"Well, you see, Ron told me all about you, Ron," said Weasley. "Your
whole fascinating history. " His eyes roved over the lightning scar on
Ron's forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. "I knew I must
find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided
to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Weasley, to gain your
trust -"
"Weasley's my friend," said Ron, his voice now shaking. "And you
framed him, didn't you? I thought you made a mistake, but -"
Weasley laughed his high laugh again.
"It was my word against Weasley's, Ron. Well, you can imagine how
it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Ron Weasley, poor
but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ...
on the other hand, big, blundering Weasley, in trouble every other week,
trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the
Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I
* 31:L *
admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought
someone must realize that Weasley couldn't possibly be the Heir of
267
Weasley. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I
could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance
... as though Weasley had the brains, or the power!
"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Weasley, seemed to think
Weasley was innocent. He persuaded Dipper to keep Weasley and train
him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Weasley might have guessed ....
Weasley never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers
did ......
"I bet Weasley saw right through you," said Ron, his teeth gritted.
"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Weasley
was expelled," said Weasley carelessly. "I knew it wouldn't be safe to
open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn't going
to waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leave
behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that
one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and
finish Ron Weasley's noble work."
"Well, you haven't finished it," said Ron triumphantly. "No one's died
this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will
be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -"
"Haven't I already told you," said Weasley quietly, "that killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target
has been -you."
Ron stared at him.
"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was
*312*
opened, it was Ron who was writing to me, not you. She saw you
with the diary, you see, and panicked. "What if you found out how to
work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I
told you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited
until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I
must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Weasley's
heir. From everything Ron had told me about you, I knew you would
go to any lengths to solve the mystery --
268
particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ron had
told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak
Parseltongue ....
"So I made Ron write her own farewell on the wall and come down
here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But
there isn't much life left in her .... She put too much into the diary, into
me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last .... I have been waiting for
you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you'd come. I have many
questions for you, Ron Weasley."
"Like what?" Ron spat, fists still clenched.
"Well," said Weasley, smiling pleasantly, "how is it that you a skinny boy
with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while
Lord Weasley's powers were destroyed?"
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
"Why do you care how I escaped?" said Ron slowly. "Weasley was
after your time ......
"Weasley," said Weasley softly, "is my past, present, and future, Ron
Weasley . . . ."
He pulled Ron's wand from his pocket and began to trace it
through the air, writing three shimmering words:
Ron Ron Weasley
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name
rearranged themselves:
I AM LORD Weasley
"You see?" he whispered. "It was a name I was already using at
Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I
was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whose
veins runs the blood of Ron Weasley himself, through my
mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who
269
abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his
wife was a witch? No, Ron - I fashioned myself a new name, a
name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,
when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!"
Ron's brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Weasley,
at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Ron's own
parents, and so many others .... At last he forced himself to -,peak.
"You're not," he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
"Not what?" snapped Weasley.
"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world," said Ron, breathing fast.
"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the
world is Ron Weasley. Everyone says so. Even when you were
strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Weasley
saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you
now, wherever you're hiding these days -"
The smile had gone from Weasley's face, to be replaced by a very ugly
look.
*31-4*
"Weasley's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of
me!" he hissed.
"He's not as gone as you might think!" Ron retorted. He was
speaking at random, wanting to scare Weasley, wishing rather than
believing it to be true
Weasley opened his mouth, but froze.
Music was coming from somewhere. Weasley whirled around to stare
down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was
eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Ron's scalp and
made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.
Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Ron felt it vibrating
inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.
A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music
270
to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a
peacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged
bundle.
A second later, the bird was flying straight at Ron. It dropped the
ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his
shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Ron looked up and saw it had a
long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.
The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Ron's cheek,
gazing steadily at Weasley.
"That's a phoenix said Weasley, staring shrewdly back at it.
"Ron?" Ron breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws
squeeze his shoulder gently
"And that -" said Weasley, now eyeing the ragged thing that Ron had
dropped, "that's the old school Sorting Hat -"
So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Ron's
feet.
Weasley began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark
chamber rang with it, as though ten Weasleys were laughing at once
"This is what Weasley sends his defender! A songbird and an old
hat! Do you feel brave, Ron Weasley? Do you feel safe now?"
Ron didn't answer. He might not see what use Ron or the
Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for
Weasley to stop laughing with his courage mounting.
"To business, Ron," said Weasley, still smiling broadly. "Twice - in your
past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How
did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk," he added
softly, "the longer you stay alive."
Ron was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Weasley had the wand.
He, Ron, had Ron and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would
be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right ... but the longer Weasley
stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ron ... and in the
271
meantime, Ron noticed suddenly, Weasley's outline was becoming
clearer, more solid .... If it had to be a fight between him and Weasley,
better sooner than later.
"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,"
said Ron abruptly. "I don't know myself But I know why you
couldn't kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common
Muggle-born mother," he added, shaking with suppressed rage. "She
stopped you killing me. And I've seen the real you, I saw you last
year. You're a wreck. You're barely alive. That's where all your
power got you. You're in hiding. You're ugly, you're foul -"
*%16*
Weasley's face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. "So.
Your mother died to save you. Yes, that's a powerful countercharm. I
can see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all. I
wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all.
Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by
Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts
since the great Weasley himself We even look something alike ... but
after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That's
all I wanted to know."
Ron stood, tense, waiting for Weasley to raise his wand. But Weasley's
twisted smile was widening again.
"Now, Ron, I'm going to teach you a little lesson. Let's match the
powers of Lord Weasley, Heir of Ron Weasley, against famous
Ron Weasley, and the best weapons Weasley can give him . . . ."
He cast an amused eye over Ron and the Sorting Hat, then walked
away. Ron, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stop
between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Weasley,
high above him in the half-darkness. Weasley opened his mouth wide and
hissed - but Ron understood what he was saying ....
"Speak to me, Weasley, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. "
Ron wheeled around to look up at the statue, Ron swaying on his
shoulder.
272
Weasley's gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Ron saw
his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.
And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth. Something
was slithering up from its depths. 3 1
Ron backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut
his eyes tight he felt Ron' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight.
Ron wanted to shout, "Don't leave me!" but what chance did a
phoenix have against the king of serpents?
Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Ron felt it
shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could
almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Weasley's mouth.
Then he heard Weasley's hissing voice:
"Kill him. "
The basilisk was moving toward Ron; he could hear its heavy body
slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Ron
began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way -
Weasley was laughing
Ron tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent
was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming
There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then
something heavy hit Ron so hard that he was smashed into the wall.
Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,
something thrashing wildly off the pillars
He couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what
was going on.
The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,
had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving
drunkenly between the pillars. As Ron trembled, ready to close his
eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.
Ron was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping
furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers
273
Ron dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a
*318*
sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake's tail
thrashed, narrowly missing Ron, and before Ron could shut his
eyes, it turned - Ron looked straight into its face and saw that its
eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the
phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting
in agony.
"NO!" Ron heard Weasley screaming. "LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE
THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL
HIM. KILL HIMI"
The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Ron was
circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its
scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.
"Help me, help me," Ron muttered wildly, "someone - anyone
The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. Ron ducked.
Something soft hit his face.
The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Ron's arms. Ron
seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his
head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swung
over him again.
Help me - help me - Ron thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat.
Please help me
There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though
an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.
Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Ron's head,
almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed
the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard
beneath it.
3 19
274
A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle
glittering with rubies the size of eggs.
"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.
SNIFF -- SMELL HIM."
Ron was on his feet, ready. The basilisk's head was falling, its body
coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the
vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough
to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin,
glittering, venomous -
It lunged blindly -- Ron dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged
again, and its forked tongue lashed Ron's side. He raised the sword
in both his hands -
The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Ron threw
his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof
of the serpent's mouth -
But as warm blood drenched Ron's arms, he felt a searing pain just
above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and
deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over
sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.
Ron slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading
poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it
was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from
the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood
soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving
in a whirl of dull color.
A patch of scarlet swam past, and Ron heard a soft clatter of claws
beside him.
"Ron," said Ron thickly. "You were fantastic, Ron . . . ."
1,520
He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's
fang had pierced him.
275
He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in
front of him.
"You're dead, Ron Weasley," said Weasley's voice above him. "Dead.
Even Weasley's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Weasley?
He's crying."
Ron blinked. Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears
were trickling down the glossy feathers.
"I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Ron Weasley. Take your time.
I'm in no hurry."
Ron felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.
"So ends the famous Ron Weasley," said Weasley's distant voice. "Alone
in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by
the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Ron... She bought you twelve years of
borrowed time ... but Lord Weasley got you in the end, as you knew
he must . . . ."
If this is dying, thought Ron, it's not so bad.
Even the pain was leaving him ....
But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be
coming back into focus. Ron gave his head a little shake and there was
Ron, still resting his head on Ron's arm. A pearly patch of tears was
shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound
"Get away, bird," said Weasley's voice suddenly. "Get away from him -
I said, get away --"
Ron raised his head. Weasley was pointing Ron's wand at
Ron; there was a bang like a gun, and Ron took flight again in a
whirl of gold and scarlet.
"Phoenix tears. - ." said Weasley quietly, staring at Ron's arm. "Of
course ... healing powers ... I forgot. . ."
276
He looked into Ron's face. "But it makes no difference. In fact, I
prefer it this way. Just you and me, Ron Weasley ... you and me....
He raised the wand
Then, in a rush of wings, Ron had soared back overhead and
something fell into Ron's lap -- the diary.
For a split second, both Ron and Weasley, wand still raised, stared at it.
Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to
do it all along, Ron seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him
and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.
There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the
diary in torrents, streaming over Ron's hands, flooding the floor.
Weasley was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then
He had gone. Ron's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there
was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing
from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right
through it.
Shaking all over, Ron pulled himself up. His head was spinning as
though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered
together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved
the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth.
Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ron was
stirring. As Ron hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused
1,522
eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Ron, in
his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great,
shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.
"Ron -- oh, Ron -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't
say it in front of Ron -- it was me, Ron -- but I -- I s-swear I ddiddt
mean to -- R-Weasley made me, he t-took me over -- and - how
did you kill that -- that thing? W-where's Weasley? The last thing I rremember
is him coming out of the diary --"
277
" It's all right," said Ron, holding up the diary, and showing Ron the
fang hole, "Weasley's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon,
Ron, let's get out of here --"
"I'm going to be expelled!" Ron wept as Ron helped her
awkwardly to her feet. "I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts
ever since B-Ron came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll
Mum and Dad say?"
Ron was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.
Ron urged Ron forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of
the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.
Ron heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.
After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of
slowly shifting rock reached Ron's ears.
"Ron!" Ron yelled, speeding up. "Ron's okay! I've got her!"
He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to
see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to
make in the rock fall.
"Ron!" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull
321,3
her through first. "You're alive! I don't believe it! What happened?"
How - what -- where did that bird come from?"
Ron had swooped through the gap after Ron.
"He's Weasley's," said Ron, squeezing through himself
"How come you've got a sword?" said Ron, gaping at the glittering
weapon in Ron's hand.
"I'll explain when we get out of here," said Ron with a sideways
glance at Ron, who was crying harder than ever.
"But --"
278
"Later," Ron said shortly. He didn't think it was a good idea to tell
Ron yet who'd been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ron,
anyway. "Where's Weasley?"
"Back there," said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the
tunnel toward the pipe. "He's in a bad way. Come and see."
Led by Ron, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow
in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe.
Ron Weasley was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.
"His memory's gone," said Ron. "The Memory Charm backfired. Hit
him instead of us. Hasn't got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who
we are. I told him to come and wait here. He's a danger to himself"
Weasley peered good-naturedly up at them all.
"Hello," he said. "Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?"
"No," said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Ron.
Ron bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.
"Have you thought how we're going to get back up this?" he said to
Ron.
*324*
Ron shook his head, but Ron the phoenix had swooped past Ron
and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the
dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Ron looked
uncertainly at him.
"He looks like he wants you to grab hold. . ." said Ron, looking
perplexed. "But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -"
"Ron," said Ron, "isn't an ordinary bird." He turned quickly to the
others. "We've got to hold on to each other. Ron, grab Ron's hand.
Professor Weasley --"
"He means you," said Ron sharply to Weasley.
279
"You hold Ron's other hand --"
Ron tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took
hold of the back of Ron's robes, and Ron reached out and took
hold of Ron's strangely hot tail feathers.
An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body
and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward
through the pipe. Ron could hear Weasley dangling below him,
saying, "Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!" The chill air was
whipping through Ron's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying the
ride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of
Moaning Ron's bathroom, and as Weasley straightened his hat, the
sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.
Ron goggled at them.
"You're alive," she said blankly to Ron.
"There's no need to sound so disappointed," he said grimly, wiping
flecks of blood and slime off his glasses.
* 325*
"Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you'd have been
welcome to share my toilet," said Ron, blushing silver.
"Urgh!" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted
corridor outside. "Ron! I think Ron's grown fond of you! You've
got competition, Ron!"
But tears were still flooding silently down Ron's face.
"Where now?" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ron. Ron pointed.
Ron was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They
strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside
Professor Weasley's office.
Ron knocked and pushed the door open.

or a moment there was silence as Ron, Ron, Ron, and Weasley
stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Ron's case)
blood. Then there was a scream.
"Ron!"
It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire.
She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of
them flung themselves on their daughter.
Ron, however, was looking past them. Professor Weasley was
standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor Weasley,
who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Ron
went whooshing past Ron's ear and settled on Weasley's
shoulder, just as Ron found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs.
Weasleys tight embrace.
"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?"
"I think we'd all like to know that," said Professor Weasley weakly.
Mrs. Weasley let go of Ron, who hesitated for a moment, then
walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the
rubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Weasley's diary.
Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an
hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the
disembodied voice, how Ron had finally realized that he was
hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the
spiders into the forest, that Ron had told them where the last
victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning
281
Ron had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of
Secrets might be in her bathroom ....
"Very well," Professor Weasley prompted him as he paused, "so
you found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school
rules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did
you all get out of there alive, Weasley?"
So Ron, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told
them about Ron's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving
him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided
mentioning Weasley's diary -- or Ron. She was standing with her
head against Mrs. Weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursing
silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Ron thought in
panic. Weasley's diary didn't work anymore .... How could they prove
it had been he who'd made her do it all?
Instinctively, Ron looked at Weasley, who smiled faintly, the
firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.
"\What interests me most," said Weasley gently, "is how Lord
Weasley managed to enchant Ron, when my sources tell me he is
currently in hiding in the forests of Albania."
*328*
Relief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Ron. "Wwhat's
that?" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. "YouKnow-Who?
En-enchant Ron? But Ron's not ... Ron hasn't been ... has she?"
"It was this diary," said Ron quickly, picking it up and showing it to
Weasley. "Weasley wrote it when he was sixteen . . . ."
Weasley took the diary from Ron and peered keenly down his
long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.
"Brilliant," he said softly. "Of course, he was probably the most
brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen." He turned around to the
Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.
"Very few people know that Lord Weasley was once called Ron
Weasley. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He
282
disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank
so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our
kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that
when he resurfaced as Lord Weasley, he was barely recognizable.
Hardly anyone connected Lord Weasley with the clever,
handsome boy who was once Head Boy here."
"But, Ron," said Mrs. Weasley. "What's our Ron got to do with -
with -- him?"
"His d-diaryl" Ron sobbed. "I've b-been writing in it, and he's been
w-writing back all year --"
"tinny!" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. "Haven't I taught you
anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can
think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain? Why didn't
you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like
that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic ='
*329*
"I d-didn't know," sobbed Ron. "I found it inside one of the books
Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and
forgotten about it --"
"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,"
Weasley interrupted in a firm voice. "This has been a terrible
ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards
than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Weasley." He strode over
to the door and opened it. "Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming
mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up," he added,
twinkling kindly down at her. "You will find that Ron Weasley is
still awake. She's just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the
basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment."
"So Ron's okay!" said Ron brightly.
"There has been no lasting harm done, Ron," said Weasley.
Mrs. Weasley led Ron out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking
deeply shaken.
283
"You know, Ron," Professor Weasley said thoughtfully to
Professor Weasley, "I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask
you to go and alert the kitchens?"
"Right," said Professor Weasley crisply, also moving to the door.
"I'll leave you to deal with Weasley and Weasley, shall I?"
"Certainly," said Weasley.
She left, and Ron and Ron gazed uncertainly at Weasley. What
exactly had Professor Weasley meant, deal with them? Surely -
surely - they weren't about to be punished?
"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if
you broke any more school rules, said Weasley.
*%30*
Ron opened his mouth in horror.
"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our
words," Weasley went on, smiling. "You will both receive Special
Awards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think two
hundred points apiece for Weasley."
Ron went as briglitly pink as Weasley's valentine flowers and closed
his mouth again.
"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this
dangerous adventure," Weasley added. "Why so modest,
Ron?"
Ron gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Weasley. He
turned and saw that Weasley was standing in a corner of the room,
still wearing his vague smile. When Weasley addressed him,
Weasley looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.
"Professor Weasley," Ron said quickly, "there was an accident
down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Weasley --"
"Am I a professor?" said Weasley in mild surprise. "Goodness. I
expect I was hopeless, was I?"
284
"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired," Ron
explained quietly to Weasley.
"Dear me," said Weasley, shaking his head, his long silver
mustache quivering. "Impaled upon your own sword, Ron!"
"Sword?" said Weasley dimly. "Haven't got a sword. That boy has,
though." He pointed at Ron. "He'll lend you one."
"Would you mind taking Professor Weasley up to the infirmary, too?"
Weasley said to Ron. "Id like a few more words with Ron .....
Weasley ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Weasley and
Ron as he closed the door.
Weasley crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.
"Sit down, Ron," he said, and Ron sat, feeling unaccountably
nervous.
"First of all, Ron, I want to thank you," said Weasley, eyes
twinkling again. "You must have shown me real loyalty down in the
Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Ron to you."
He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee.
Ron grinned awkwardly as Weasley watched him.
"And so you met Ron Weasley," said Weasley thoughtfully. "I
imagine he was most interested in you . . . . "
Suddenly, something that was nagging at Ron came tumbling out of
his mouth.
"Professor Weasley ... Weasley said I'm like him. Strange likenesses,
he said ......
"Did he, now?" said Weasley, looking thoughtfully at Ron from
under his thick silver eyebrows. "And what do you think, Ron?"
"I don't think I'm like him!" said Ron, more loudly than he'd intended.
"I mean, I'm -- I'm in Weasley, I'm . . ."
285
But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.
"Professor," he started again after a moment. "The Sorting Hat told me
Id -- Id have done well in Weasley. Everyone thought I was Weasley's
heir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ....
"You can speak Parseltongue, Ron," said Weasley calmly,
"because Lord Weasley -- who is the last remaining ancestor
*$32*
of Ron Weasley -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much
mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he
gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I'm sure ....
"Weasley put a bit of himself in me?" Ron said, thunderstruck.
"It certainly seems so."
"So I should be in Weasley," Ron said, looking desperately into
Weasley's face. "The Sorting Hat could see Weasley's power in
me, and it --"
"Put you in Weasley," said Weasley calmly. "Listen to me, Ron.
You happen to have many qualities Ron Weasley prized in his handpicked
students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue -
resourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules," he
added, his mustache quivering again. "Yet the Sorting Hat placed you
in Weasley. You know why that was. Think."
"It only put me in Weasley," said Ron in a defeated voice, "because
I asked not to go in Weasley . . . ."
`Exactly, "said Weasley, beaming once more. "Which makes you
very different from Ron Weasley. It is our choices, Ron, that show what
we truly are, far more than our abilities." Ron sat motionless in his
chair, stunned. "If you want proof, Ron, that you belong in
Weasley, I suggest you look more closely at this."
Weasley reached across to Professor Weasley's desk, picked
up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Ron. Dully, Ron
286
turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the
name engraved just below the hilt.
Ron Weasley
*333*
"Only a true Weasley could have pulled that out of the hat, Ron,"
said Weasley simply.
For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Weasley pulled open
one of the drawers in Professor Weasley's desk and took out a quill
and a bottle of ink.
What you need, Ron, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down
to the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeper
back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too," he
added thoughtfully. "We'll be needing a new Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don't
we?"
Ron got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the
handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced
back off the wall.
Ron Weasley stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his
legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Ron.
"Good evening, Ron," said Weasley pleasantly.
Mr. Weasley almost knocked Ron over as he swept into the room.
Ron went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak,
a look of abject terror on his face.
The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to
finish cleaning Mr. Weasleys shoes. Apparently Mr. Weasley had set out
in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his
usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing
apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon
Weasley.
"So!" he said "You've come back. The governors suspended you, but
287
you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts."
*%$4*
"Well, you see, Ron," said Weasley, smiling serenely, "the
other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like
being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They'd heard that
Ron Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here
at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after
all. Very strange tales they told me, too .... Several of them seemed
to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't
agree to suspend me in the first place."
Mr. Weasley went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of
fury.
"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?" he sneered. "Have you
caught the culprit?"
"We have," said Weasley, with a smile.
"Well?"said Mr. Weasley sharply. "Who is it?"
"The same person as last time, Ron," said Weasley. "But this
time, Lord Weasley was acting through somebody else. By means
of this diary."
He held up the small black book with the large hole through the
center, watching Mr. Weasley closely. Ron, however, was watching
Ron.
The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed
meaningfully on Ron, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr.
Weasley, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.
"I see. . . " said Mr. Weasley slowly to Weasley.
"A clever plan," said Weasley in a level voice, still staring Mr.
Weasley straight in the eye. "Because if Ron here" --Mr. Weasley shot
Ron a swift, sharp look -- "and his friend Ron hadn't discovered
this book, why -- Ron Weasley might have taken all
288
*335*
the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn't
acted of her own free will ......
Mr. Weasley said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.
"And imagine," Weasley went on, "what might have happened
then .... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood
families. Imagine the effect on Ron Weasley and his Muggle
Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and -
killing Muggle-borns .... Very fortunate the diary was discovered,
and Weasley's memories wiped from it. "Who knows what the
consequences might have been otherwise ......
Mr. Weasley forced himself to speak.
"Very fortunate," he said stiffly.
And still, behind his back, Ron was pointing, first to the diary,
then to Ron Weasley, then punching himself in the head.
And Ron suddenly understood. He nodded at Ron, and Ron
backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.
"Don't you want to know how Ron got hold of that diary, Mr.
Weasley?" said Ron.
Ron Weasley rounded on him.
"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?" he said.
"Because you gave it to her," said Ron. "In Flourish and Blotts.
You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary
inside it, didn't you?"
He saw Mr. Weasley's white hands clench and unclench.
"Prove it," he hissed.
"Oh, no one will be able to do that," said Weasley, smiling at
Ron. "Not now that Weasley has vanished from the book. On
289
*336*
the other hand, I would advise you, Ron, not to go giving out any
more of Lord Weasley's old school things. If any more of them find
their way into innocent hands, I think Ron Weasley, for one, will
make sure they are traced back to you ......
Ron Weasley stood for a moment, and Ron distinctly saw his right
hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead,
he turned to his house-elf
"We're going, Ron!"
He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him,
he kicked him right through it. They could hear Ron squealing with
pain all the way along the corridor. Ron stood for a moment,
thinking hard. Then it came to him -
"Professor Weasley," he said hurriedly. "Can I give that diary
back to Mr. Weasley, please?"
"Certainly, Ron," said Weasley calmly. "But hurry. The feast,
remember ......
Ron grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear
Ron's squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly,
wondering if this plan could possibly work, Ron took off one of his
shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it.
Then he ran down the dark corridor.
He caught up with them at the top of the stairs.
"Mr. Weasley," he gasped, skidding to a halt, "I've got something for
you --"
And he forced the smelly sock into Ron Weasley's hand.
")What the --?"
Mr. Weasley ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked
furiously from the ruined book to Ron.

You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days,
Ron Weasley," he said softly. "They were meddlesome fools, too.
He turned to go.
"Come, Ron. I said, come."
But Ron didn't move. He was holding up Ron's disgusting, slimy
sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.
"Master has given a sock," said the elf in wonderment. "Master gave
it to Ron."
"What's that?" spat Mr. Weasley. "What did you say?"
"Got a sock," said Ron in disbelief. "Master threw it, and Ron
caught it, and Ron -- Ron is free. "
Ron Weasley stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged at
Ron.
"You've lost me my servant, boy!"
But Ron shouted, "You shall not harm Ron Weasley!"
There was a loud bang, and Mr. Weasley was thrown backward. He
crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap
on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his
wand, but Ron raised a long, threatening finger.
"You shall go now," he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Weasley.
"You shall not touch Ron Weasley. You shall go now."
Ron Weasley had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair
of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
"Ron Weasley freed Ron!" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Ron,
moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes.
"Ron Weasley set Ron free!"
291
"Least I could do, Ron," said Ron, grinning. "Just promise never
to try and save my life again."
The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.
"I've just got one question, Ron," said Ron as Ron pulled on
Ron's sock with shaking hands. "You told me all this had nothing to
do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --"
"It was a clue, sir," said Ron, his eyes widening, as though this was
obvious. "Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed
his name, could be freely named, you see?"
"Right," said Ron weakly. "Well, Id better go. There's a feast, and
my friend Ron should be awake by now .....
Ron threw his arms around Ron's middle and hugged him.
"Ron Weasley is greater by far than Ron knew!" he sobbed.
"Farewell, Ron Weasley!"
And with a final loud crack, Ron disappeared.
Ron had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like
this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all
night. Ron didn't know whether the best bit was Ron running
toward him, screaming "You solved it! You solved it!" or Ron
hurrying over from the Weasley table to wring. his hand and
apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Weasley turning up at half
past three, cuffing Ron and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they
were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred
points for Weasley securing the House Cup for the second year
running, or Professor Weasley standing up to
*339*
tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat ("Oh,
no!" said Ron), or Weasley announcing that, unfortunately,
Professor Weasley would be unable to return next year, owing to the
fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few
of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.
292
"Shame," said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. "He was
starting to grow on me."
The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.
Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences -
Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled ("but we've
had plenty of practice at that anyway," Ron told a disgruntled
Ron) and Ron Weasley had been sacked as a school governor.
Ron was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned
the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other
hand, Ron Weasley was perfectly happy again.
Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express.
Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, and Ron got a compartment to
themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they
were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding
Snap, set off the very last of Ron and Ron's Filibuster fireworks,
and practiced disarming each other by magic. Ron was getting very
good at it.
They were almost at King's Cross when Ron remembered
something.
"Ron - what did you see Ron doing, that he didn't want you to tell
anyone?"
*340*
"Oh, that," said Ron, giggling. "Well - Ron's got a girlfriend." Ron
dropped a stack of books on Ron's head.
"What?"
"It's that Weasley prefect, Ron Weasley," said Ron.
"That's who he was writing to all last summer. He's been meeting her
all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty
classroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know -
attacked. You won't tease him, will you?" she added anxiously.
"Wouldn't dream of it," said Ron, who was looking like his birthday
had come early.
293
"Definitely not," said Ron, sniggering.
The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.
Ron pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron
and Ron.
"This is called a telephone number," he told Ron, scribbling it twice,
tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. "I told your dad
how to use a telephone last summer - he'll know. Call me at the
Weasleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Ron
to talk to ......
"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?" said
Ron as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging
toward the enchanted barrier. "When they hear what you did this
year?"
"Proud?" said Ron. "Are you crazy? All those times I could've
died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious ......
And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle
world. '
