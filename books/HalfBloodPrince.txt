Chapter 1: The Other Minister
It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government's fault.
The Prime Minister's pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it his fault that one of his Junior
Ministers, Herbert Ronrley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?
"A grim mood has gripped the country," the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.
And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of July... It wasn't right, it wasn't normal...
He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.
He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room.
"Hello?" he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.
For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was coming -- as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough -- from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.
"To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Weasley."
The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.
"Er," said the Prime Minister, "listen... It's not a very good time for me... I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see... from the President of--"
"That can be rearranged," said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that.
"But I really was rather hoping to speak--"
"We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead," said the little man. "Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Weasley."
"I... oh... very well," said the Prime Minister weakly. "Yes, I'll see Weasley."
He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand.
"Ah... Prime Minister," said Ron Weasley, striding forward with his hand outstretched. "Good to see you again."
The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Weasley, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Weasley was looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.
"How can I help you?" he said, shaking Weasley's hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.
"Difficult to know where to begin," muttered Weasley, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his knees. "What a week, what a week..."
"Had a bad one too, have you?" asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Weasley.
"Yes, of course," said Weasley, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. "I've been having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge... the Weasley and Weasley murders... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country..."
"You--er--your--I mean to say, some of your people were--were involved in those--those things, were they?"
Weasley fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. "Of course they were," he said, "Surely you've realized what's going on?"
"I..." hesitated the Prime Minister.
It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Weasley's visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Weasley on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.
He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ugly little portrait
talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself
Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Weasley's kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them. It was, said Weasley, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Weasley had then patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.
"Not to worry," he had said, "it's odds-on you'll never see me again. I'll only bother you if there's something really serious going on our end, something that's likely to affect the Muggles--the non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it's live and let live. And I must say, you're taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition."
At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. "You're--you're not a hoax, then?"
It had been his last, desperate hope.
"No," said Weasley gently. "No, I'm afraid I'm not. Look."
And he had turned the Prime Minister's teacup into a gerbil.
"But," said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, "but why--why has nobody told me--?"
"The Minister of Magic only reveals him--or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day," said Weasley, poking his wand back inside his jacket. "We find it the best way to maintain secrecy."
"But then," bleated the Prime Minister, "why hasn't a former Prime Minister warned me--?"
At this, Weasley had actually laughed.
"My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?"
Still chortling, Weasley had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?
The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Weasley had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Weasley's arrival. To the Prime Minister's dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to pry it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.
Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Weasley, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Weasley had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named "Serious" Weasley, something that sounded like "Hogwarts," and a boy called Ron Weasley, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.
"...I've just come from Azkaban," Weasley had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. "Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight... the dementors are in uproar"--he shuddered--"they've never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Weasley's a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who... But of course, you don't even know who You-Know-Who is!" He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, "Well, sit down, sit down, I'd better fill you in... Have a whiskey..."
The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Weasley pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister's hand, and drew up a chair.
Weasley had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister's whiskey-free hand. When at last Weasley had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.
"So you think that..." He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. "Lord Vol--"
"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!" snarled Weasley.
"I'm sorry... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still alive, then?"
"Well, Weasley says he is," said Weasley, as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, "but we've never found him. If you ask me, he's not dangerous unless he's got support, so it's Weasley we ought to be worrying about. You'll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don't see each other again, Prime Minister! Good night."
But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassed-looking Weasley had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been "involved," but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-Know-Who's Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Weasley was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.
"Oh, and I almost forgot," Weasley had added. "We're importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we're bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country."
"I--what--dragons?" spluttered the Prime Minister.
"Yes, three," said Weasley. "And a sphinx. Well, good day to you."
The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, Weasley had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.
"A mass breakout?" repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.
"No need to worry, no need to worry!" shouted Weasley, already with one foot in the flames. "We'll have them rounded up in no time--just thought you ought to know!"
And before the Prime Minister could shout, "Now, wait just one moment!" Weasley had vanished in a shower of green sparks.
Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite Weasley's assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Weasley was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Weasley in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Weasley appeared it would be with graver news still. The site, therefore, of Weasley stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.
"How should I know what's going on in the--er--Wizarding community?" snapped the Prime Minister now. "I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without--"
"We have the same concerns," Weasley interrupted. "The Brock-dale Bridge didn't wear out. That wasn't really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Ronrley's family would be safer without him. We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be affected tonight."
"What do you... I'm afraid I... What?" blustered the Prime Minister.
Weasley took a great, deep breath and said, "Prime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he's back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back."
"Back? When you say 'back'... he's alive? I mean--"
The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously, when Weasley had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.
"Yes, alive," said Weasley. "That is--I don't know--is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really understand it, and Weasley won't explain
properly--but anyway, he's certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he's alive."
The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.
"Is Serious Weasley with--er--He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?"
"Weasley? Weasley?" said Weasley distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. "Ron Weasley, you mean? Merlin's beard, no. Weasley's dead. Turns out we were--er--mistaken about Weasley. He was innocent after all. And he wasn't in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean," he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, "all the evidence pointed--we had more than fifty eyewitnesses--but anyway, as I say, he's dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There's going to be an inquiry, actually..."
To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Weasley at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge... Not yet, anyway...
While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Weasley continued, "But Weasleys by-the-by now. The point is, we're at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken."
"At war?" repeated the Prime Minister nervously. "Surely that's a little bit of an overstatement?"
"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January," said Weasley, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur. "Since they have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridge--he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and--"
"Good grief, so it's your fault those people were killed and I'm having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don't know what else!" said the Prime Minister furiously.
"My fault!" said Weasley, coloring up. "Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that?"
"Maybe not," said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about the room, "but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!"
"Do you really think I wasn't already making every effort?" demanded Weasley heatedly. "Every Auror in the Ministry was--and is--trying to find him
and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!"
"So I suppose you're going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?" said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the government's fault after all.
"That was no hurricane," said Weasley miserably.
"Excuse me!" barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. "Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries--"
"It was the Death Eaters," said Weasley. "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's followers. And... and we suspect giant involvement."
The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. "What involvement?"
Weasley grimaced. "He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect," he said. "The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, we've had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we've got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can't find the giant--it's been a disaster."
"You don't say!" said the Prime Minister furiously.
"I won't deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry," said Weasley. "What with all that, and then losing Ron Weasley."
"Losing who?"
"Ron Weasley. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch and--and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight."
Weasley cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat.
"But that murder was in the newspapers," said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. "Our newspapers. Ron Weasley... it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a--a nasty killing, wasn't it? It's had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled, you see."
Weasley sighed. "Well, of course they are," he said. "Killed in a room that was locked from the inside, wasn't she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further toward catching him. And then there was Ron Weasley, maybe you didn't hear about that one--"
"Oh yes I did!" said the Prime Minister. "It happened just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a field day with it, 'breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister's backyard--'"
"And as if all that wasn't enough," said Weasley, barely listening to the Prime Minister, "we've got dementors swarming all over the place, attacking people left, right, and center..."
Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.
"I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban," he said cautiously.
"They did," said Weasley wearily. "But not anymore. They've deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I won't pretend that wasn't a blow."
"But," said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, "didn't you tell me they're the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?"
"That's right. And they're breeding. That's what's causing all this mist."
The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite faint.
"Now see here, Weasley--you've got to do something! It's your responsibility as Minister of Magic!"
"My dear Prime Minister, you can't honestly think I'm still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I've never known them so united in my whole term of office!" said Weasley, with a brave attempt at a smile.
The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.
"I'm very sorry," he said finally. "If there's anything I can do?"
"It's very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought he'd be here by now, but of course, he's very busy at the moment, with so much going on."
Weasley looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching Weasley's eye, the portrait said, "He'll be here in a moment, he's just finishing a letter to Weasley."
"I wish him luck," said Weasley, sounding bitter for the first time. "I've been writing to Weasley twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won't budge.
If he'd just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still be... Well, maybe Weasley will have more success."
Weasley subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.
"To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Ron Weasley, Minister of Magic."
"Yes, yes, fine," said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.
Weasley got to his feet and, after a moment's hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.
The Prime Minister's first, foolish thought was that Ron Weasley looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Weasley to Weasley as a leader in these dangerous times.
"How do you do?" said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.
Weasley grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.
"Weasley told you everything?" he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
"Er--yes," said the Prime Minister. "And if you don't mind, I'd rather that door remained unlocked."
"I'd rather not be interrupted," said Weasley shortly, "or watched," he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. "Right, well, I'm a busy man, so let's get down lo business. First of all, we need to discuss your security."
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, "I am perfectly happy with the security I've already got, thank you very--"
"Well, we're not," Weasley cut in. "It'll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in your outer office--"
"I'm not getting rid of Ron Weasley, if that's what you're suggesting!" said the Prime Minister hotly. "He's highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them--"
"That's because he's a wizard," said Weasley, without a flicker of a smile. "A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection."
"Now, wait a moment!" declared the Prime Minister. "You can't just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me--"
"I thought you were happy with Weasley?" said Weasley coldly.
"I am--that's to say, I was--"
"Then there's no problem, is there?" said Weasley.
"I... well, as long as Weasley's work continues to be... er... excellent," said the Prime Minister lamely, but Weasley barely seemed to hear him.
"Now, about Herbert Ronrley, your Junior Minister," he continued. "The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck."
"What about him?" asked the Prime Minister.
"He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse," said Weasley. "It's addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous."
"He's only quacking!" said the Prime Minister weakly. "Surely a bit of a rest... Maybe go easy on the drink..."
"A team of Healers from St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them," said Weasley. "I think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while."
"I... well... He'll be all right, won't he?" said the Prime Minister anxiously.
Weasley merely shrugged, already moving back toward the fireplace.
"Well, that's really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Minister--or, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Weasley here. He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity."
Weasley attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked as though he had a toothache. Weasley was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.
"But for heaven's sake--you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out--well--anything!"
Weasley turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Weasley, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, "The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister."
And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished.
Chapter 2: Spinner's End
Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Minister's windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish-strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass.
But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.
With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.
"Wait!"
The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.
The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
"Just a fox," said a woman's voice dismissively from under the hood. "I thought perhaps an Auror--Cissy, wait!"
But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down.
"Cissy--Ron--listen to me--"
The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other wrenched it away.
"Go back, Weasleya!"
"You must listen to me!"
"I've listened already. I've made my decision. Leave me alone!"
The woman named Ron gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman, Weasleya, followed at once. Side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.
"He lives here?" asked Weasleya in a voice of contempt. "Here? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot--"
But Ron was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.
"Cissy, waitl"
Weasleya followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Ron darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other.
"Cissy, you must not do this, you can't trust him--"
"The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn't he?"
"The Dark Lord is... I believe... mistaken," Weasleya panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. "In any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord's--"
"Let go, Weasleya!" snarled Ron, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the other's face. Weasleya merely laughed.
"Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn't--"
"There is nothing I wouldn't do anymore!" Ron breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Weasleya let go of her sister's arm as though burned.
"Ron!"
But Ron had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Ron hurried up a street named Spinner's End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.
She had knocked on the door before Weasleya, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.
Ron threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.
"Ron!" said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. "What a pleasant surprise!
"Ron," she said in a strained whisper. "May I speak to you? It's urgent."
"But of course."
He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her still-hooded sister followed without invitation.
"Weasley," she said curtly as she passed him.
"Weasleyatrix," he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.
They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually inhabited.
Weasley gestured Ron to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. Weasleyatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her gaze from Weasley as she moved to stand behind Ron.
"So, what can I do for you?" Weasley asked, settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.
"We... we are alone, aren't we?" Ron asked quietly.
'Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail's here, but we're not counting vermin, are we?"
He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen.
"As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests," said Weasley lazily.
The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his right, which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove.
"Ron!" he said, in a squeaky voice. "And Weasleyatrix! How charming--"
"Wormtail will get us drinks, if you'd like them," said Weasley. "And then he will return to his bedroom."
Wormtail winced as though Weasley had thrown something at him.
"I am not your servant!" he squeaked, avoiding Weasley's eye.
"Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me."
"To assist, yes--but not to make you drinks and--and clean your house!"
"I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments," said Weasley silkily. "This can be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord--"
"I can speak to him myself if I want to!"
"Of course you can," said Weasley, sneering. "But in the meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine will do."
Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door. They heard banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the book-covered door behind him.
Weasley poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters. Ron murmured a word of thanks, whilst Weasleyatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Weasley. This did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.
"The Dark Lord," he said, raising his glass and draining it.
The sisters copied him. Weasley refilled their glasses. As Ron took her second drink she said in a rush, "Ron, I'm sorry to come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only one who can help me--"
Weasley held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.
"My apologies," said Weasley. "He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don't know what he means by it... You were saying, Ron?"
She took a great, shuddering breath and started again.
"Ron, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, but--"
"Then you ought to hold your tongue!" snarled Weasleyatrix. "Particularly in present company!"
'"Present company'?" repeated Weasley sardonically. "And what am I to understand by that, Weasleyatrix?"
"That I don't trust you, Weasley, as you very well know!"
Ron let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands. Weasley set his glass down upon the table and sat back
again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Weasleyatrix's glowering face.
"Ron, I think we ought to hear what Weasleyatrix is bursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Weasleyatrix," said Weasley. "Why is it that you do not trust me?"
"A hundred reasons!" she said loudly, striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. "Where to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that you've lived in Weasley's pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer's Stone? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Weasley, is Ron Weasley still alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?"
She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks. Behind her, Ron sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.
Weasley smiled.
"Before I answer you -- oh yes, Weasleyatrix, I am going to answer! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not
asked me each and every one of those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?"
She hesitated.
"I know he believes you, but..."
"You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?"
Weasleyatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Weasley did not press the point. He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, "You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Ron Weasley. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lord's orders that I took up the post?"
She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Weasley forestalled her.
"You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. For the same reason that Avery, Weasley, the Weasleys, Weasley, Ron" -- he inclined his head slightly to Ron -- "and many others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but
there it is... If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers left."
"He'd have me!" said Weasleyatrix passionately. "I, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!"
"Yes, indeed, most admirable," said Weasley in a bored voice. "Of i nurse, you weren't a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine --"
"Gesture!" she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. "While I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, com-lortably playing Weasley's pet!"
"Not quite," said Weasley calmly. "He wouldn't give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse ,.. tempt me into my old ways."
"This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favorite subject?" she jeered. "Why did you stay there all that time, Weasley? Still spying on Weasley for a master you believed dead?"
"Hardly," said Weasley, "although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Weasley to give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is..."
"But you stayed --"
"Yes, Weasleyatrix, I stayed," said Weasley, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. "I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know. Weasley's protection kept me out of jail; it was most convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.
"I think you next wanted to know," he pressed on, ;i little more loudly, for Weasleyatrix showed every sign of interrupting, "why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer's Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Weasley's stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Weasley or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Weasley attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him."
Weasleyatrix's mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.
"But you didn't return when he came back, you didn't fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn --"
"Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on Weasley's orders."
"On Weasley's -- ?" she began, in tones of outrage.
"Think!" said Weasley, impatient again. "Think! By waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing Weasley to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lord's side because I was ordered to, I have been able to pass information on Weasley and the Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Weasleyatrix: The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months. I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to escape like Weasley, didn't I?
"The Dark Lord's initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely, 1 assure you, when I explained that 1 remained faithful, although Weasley thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong."
"But what use have you been?" sneered Weasleyatrix. "What useful information have we had from you?"
"My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord," said Weasley. "If he chooses not to share it with you --"
"He shares everything with me!" said Weasleyatrix, firing up at once. "He calls me his most loyal, his most faithful --"
"Does he?" said Weasley, his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief. "Does he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?"
"That was not my fault!" said Weasleyatrix, flushing. "The Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious -- if Ron hadn't --"
"Don't you dare -- don't you dare blame my husband!" said Ron, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.
"There is no point apportioning blame," said Weasley smoothly. "What is done, is done."
"But not by you!" said Weasleyatrix furiously. "No, you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Weasley?"
"My orders were to remain behind," said Weasley. "Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Weasley would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And -- forgive me -- you speak of dangers... you were facing six teenagers, were you not?"
"They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!" snarled Weasleyatrix. "And, while we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, don't you?"
"I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name of the place. You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and murder of Ron Weasley, and it certainly helped dispose of Ron Weasley, though I give you full credit for finishing him off."
He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did nor soften.
"You are avoiding my last question, Weasley. Ron Weasley. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?"
"Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?" asked Weasley.
"He... lately, we... I am asking you, Weasley!"
"If I had murdered Ron Weasley, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible --"
"You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!" she jeered.
"I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Weasley survived, at least until a year ago..."
"But why did you keep him alive?"
"Have you not understood me? It was only Weasley's protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Weasley first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Weasley might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, 1 admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle.
"Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Weasley close at hand."
"And through all this we are supposed to believe Weasley has never suspected you?" asked Weasleyatrix. "He has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?"
"I have played my part well," said Weasley. "And you overlook Weasley's greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death
Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms -- though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Weasley has been a great wizard -- oh yes, he has," (for Weasleyatrix had made a scathing noise), "the Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Weasley is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Ron Weasley, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord."
Weasleyatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Weasley next. Taking advantage of her silence, Weasley turned to her sister.
"Now... you came to ask me for help, Ron?"
Ron looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.
"Yes, Ron. I -- I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Ron is in jail and..."
She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.
"The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it," Ron continued, her eyes still closed. "He wishes none to know of the plan. It is... very secret. But --"
"If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak," said Weasley at once. "The Dark Lord's word is law."
Ron gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Weasleyatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house.
"There!" she said triumphantly to her sister. "Even Weasley says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!"
But Weasley had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Ron, frowning.
"It so happens that I know of the plan," he said in a low voice. "I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Ron, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord."
"I thought you must know about it!" said Ron, breathing more freely. "He trusts you so, Ron..."
"You know about the plan?" said Weasleyatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. "You know?"
"Certainly," said Weasley. "But what help do you require, Nar-cissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all."
"Ron," she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. "My son... my only son..."
"Ron should be proud," said Weasleyatrix indifferently. "The Dark I ,ord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Ron: I Ic isn't shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, excited at the prospect --"
Ron began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Weasley.
"That's because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Ron? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance lor Ron's mistake, I know it!"
Weasley said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.
"That's why he's chosen Ron, isn't it?" she persisted. "To punish Ron?"
"If Ron succeeds," said Weasley, still looking away from her, "he will be honored above all others."
"But he won't succeed!" sobbed Ron. "How can he, when the Dark Lord himself-- ?"
Weasleyatrix gasped; Ron seemed to lose her nerve.
"I only meant... that nobody has yet succeeded... Ron... please... You are, you have always been, Ron's favorite teacher... You are Ron's old friend... I beg you... You are the Dark Lord's favorite, his most trusted advisor... Will you speak to him, persuade him -- ?"
"The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it," said Weasley flatly. "I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Ron. Ron was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Ron, very angry indeed."
"Then I am right, he has chosen Ron in revenge!" choked Ron. "He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!"
When Weasley said nothing, Ron seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed. Ronding up, she staggered to Weasley and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his chest, she gasped, "You could do it. You could do it instead of Ron, Ron. You would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us --"
Weasley caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, "He intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Ron should try first. You
see, in the unlikely event that Ron succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy."
"In other words, it doesn't matter to him if Ron is killed!"
"The Dark Lord is very angry," repeated Weasley quietly. "He failed to hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Ron, that he does not forgive easily."
She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the (loor.
"My only son... my only son..."
"You should be proud!" said Weasleyatrix ruthlessly. "If I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!"
Ron gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. Weasley stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up, iind steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand.
"Ron, that's enough. Drink this. Listen to me."
She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.
"It might be possible... for me to help Ron."
She sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge.
"Ron -- oh, Ron -- you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?"
"I can try."
She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Weasley's feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and pressed her lips to it.
"If you are there to protect him... Ron, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?"
"The Unbreakable Vow?"
Weasley's expression was blank, unreadable. Weasleyatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.
"Aren't you listening, Ron? Oh, he'll try, I'm sure... The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action... oh, on the Dark Lord's orders, of course!"
Weasley did not look at Weasleyatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon Ron's tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.
"Certainly, Ron, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow," he said quietly. "Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder."
Weasleyatrix's mouth fell open. Weasley lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Ron. Beneath Weasleyatrix's astonished gaze, they grasped right hands.
"You will need your wand, Weasleyatrix," said Weasley coldly.
She drew it, still looking astonished.
"And you will need to move a little closer," he said.
She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands.
Ron spoke.
"Will you, Ron, watch over my son, Ron, as he attempts ta fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?"
"I will," said Weasley.
A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.
"And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"
"I will," said Weasley.
A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.
"And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Ron will fail..." whispered Ron (Weasley's hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), "will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Ron to perform?"
There was a moment's silence. Weasleyatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide.
"I will," said Weasley.
Weasleyatrix's astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a fiery snake.
Chapter 3: Will And Won't
Ron Weasley was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold win-dowpane, his glasses askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.
The room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk. The headline of one blared:
Ron Weasley: THE RonSEN ONE?
Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted once more.
"We're not allowed to talk about it, don't ask me anything" said one agitated Obliviator, who refused to give his name as he left the Ministry last night.
Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy.
Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place, a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Ron Weasley, the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question. Some are going so far as to call Weasley "the Ronsen One," believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-No t-Be-Named.
The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown, although {ctd. page2, column 5)
A second newspaper lay beside die first. This one bore die headline:
Weasley SUCCEEDS Weasley
Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The picture was moving -- the man was waving at the ceiling.
Ron Weasley, previously Head of the Auror office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Ron Weasley as Minister of
Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the Wizardmg community, though rumors of a rift between the new Minister and Ron Weasley, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Weasley taking office.
Weasleys representatives admitted that he had met with Weasley at once upon taking possession of the top job, but refused to comment on the topics under discussion. Ron Weasley is known to (ctd. page 3, column 2)
To the left of this paper sat another, which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students' sapety was visible.
Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Ron Weasley, spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this autumn.
"For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans," said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School.
Most seem reassured by the new Minister's tough stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Ron Weasley, "My grandson, Ron -- a good friend of
Ron Weasley's, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and --
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage.standing on top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Ron was too deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear, sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that
coated the very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:
----ISSUED ON BEHALF OF----
The Ministry of Magic
PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES
The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and your home from attack.
1. You are advised not to leave the house alone.
2. Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen.
3. Review the security arrangements around your house, making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage family members, Side-Along-Apparition.
4. Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2).
5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).
6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact the Auror office immediately.
7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any sighting of an In-ferius, or encounter with same, should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY.
Ron grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Ron several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by Ron's relaxed hand, was a
piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Ron had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat.
Dear Ron,
If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays.
If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you.
Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this Friday,
I am yours most sincerely,
Ron Weasley
Though he already knew it by heart, Ron had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o'clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Weasley's words; Ron had sent back his "yes" with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Weasley was going to come, or he was not.
But Ron had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Weasleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go
wrong -- his reply to Weasley's letter might have gone astray; Weasley could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Weasley at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Ron had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Ron, safely in her cage.
The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at that precise moment, the street-lamp outside the window went out.
Ron awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.
Ron jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Then as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of clasps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Ron shouted, "Who the blazes is calling at this lime of night?"
Ron froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the Weasleys that Weasley might be coming. Feeling both panicky mid close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep
voice say, "Good evening. You must be Mr. Weasley. I daresay Ron has told you I would be coming for him?"
Ron ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and.1 pointed hat. Ron Weasley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as Weasley's, though black, and who was wearing a puce dress-ing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.
"Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Ron did not warn you that I was coming," said Weasley pleasantly. "However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times."
He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him.
"It is a long time since my last visit," said Weasley, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Ron. "I must say, your agapanthus are flourishing."
Ron Weasley said nothing at all. Ron did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon -- the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was
reaching danger point -- but something about Weasley seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Ron could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.
"Ah, good evening Ron," said Weasley, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression. "Excellent, excellent."
These words seemed to rouse Uncle Ron. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Ron and say "excellent" was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.
"I don't mean to be rude --" he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable.
"--yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often," Weasley finished the sentence gravely. "Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Ron."
The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Ron's aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.
"Ron Weasley," said Weasley, when Uncle Ron failed to effect an introduction. "We have corresponded, of course." Ron thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Ron that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Ron did not challenge the term. "And this must be your son, Ron?"
Ron had that moment peered round the living room door, his large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and I car. Weasley waited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Weasleys were going to say anything, but as the •.ilcncc stretched on he smiled.
"Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room?"
Ron scrambled out of the way as Weasley passed him. I lurry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last lew stairs and followed Weasley, who had settled himself in i he armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings wilh an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.
"Aren't --- aren't we leaving, sir?" Ron asked anxiously.
"Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to dis-i us.s first," said Weasley. "And I would prefer not to do so in (he open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle's hospitality only a little longer."
"You will, will you?"
Ron Weasley had entered the room, Ron at his shoulder, iind Ron skulking behind them both.
"Yes," said Weasley simply, "I shall."
He drew his wand so rapidly that Ron barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Weasleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.
"We may as well be comfortable," said Weasley pleasantly.
As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Ron saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. 
"Sir -- what happened to your -- ?"
"Later, Ron," said Weasley. "Please sit down."
Ron took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Weasleys, who seemed stunned into silence.
"I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment," Weasley said to Uncle Ron, "but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness."
A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.
"Ron Rons finest oak-matured mead," said Weasley, raising his glass to Ron, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Weasleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Ron could not suppress a suspicion that Weasley was rather enjoying himself.
"Well, Ron," said Weasley, turning toward him, "a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Ron's will was discovered a week ago and that he left you every-ihing he owned."
Over on the sofa, Uncle Rons head turned, but Ron did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, "Oh. Right."
"This is, in the main, fairly straightforward," Weasley went on. "You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at (iringotts, and you inherit all of Ron's personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy --"
"His godfather's dead?" said Uncle Ron loudly from the sofa. 1 )umbledore and Ron both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Rons head; he attempted to beat it away. "He's dead? His godfather?"
"Yes," said Weasley. He did not ask Ron why he had not confided in the Weasleys. "Our problem," he continued to Ron, as if there had been no interruption, "is that Ron also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place."
"He's been left a house?" said Uncle Ron greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.
"You can keep using it as headquarters," said Ron. "I don't care. You can have it, I don't really want it." Ron never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Ron prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.
"That is generous," said Weasley. "We have, however, vacated the building temporarily."
"Why?"
"Well," said Weasley, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Ron, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead, "Weasley family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of 'Weasley.' Ron was the very last of the
line as his younger brother, Ron, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood."
A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Ron's mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Ron's mind. "I bet there has," he said.
"Quite," said Weasley. "And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Ron's living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Weasleyatrix Weasley."
Without realizing what he was doing, Ron sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Weasleyatrix Weasley, Ron's killer, inherit his house?
"No," he said.
"Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn't get it either," said Weasley calmly. "The situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed from Ron's hands. It might be that Weasleyatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position,"
"But how are you going to find out if I'm allowed to own it?"
"Fortunately," said Weasley, "there is a simple test."
He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle Ron shouted, "Will you get these ruddy things off us?"
Ron looked around; all three of the Weasleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.
"Oh, I'm so sorry," said Weasley politely, and he raised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. "But it would have been better manners to drink it, you know."
It looked as though Uncle Ron was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Ron and Ron and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes on Weasley's wand.
"You see," Weasley said, turning back to Ron and again speaking as though Uncle Ron had not uttered, "if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited --"
He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat's ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Weasleys' shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Ron let out a hair-raising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Ron drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Ron bellowed, "What the hell is that?"
"Ron," finished Weasley.
"Ron won’t, Ron won't, Ron won’t!" croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Ron, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling lii.s ears. "Ron belongs to Miss Weasleyatrix, oh yes, Ron belongs to the Weasleys, Ron wants his new mistress, Ron won't go to the Weasley brat, Ron won't, won't, won’t --"
"As you can see, Ron," said Weasley loudly, over Ron's continued croaks of "wont, won't, won't," "Ron is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership."
"I don't care," said Ron again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. "I don't want him."
"Won't, won’t, won't, won't --"
"You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Weasleyatrix Weasley? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?"
"Won't, won't, won’t, won't --"
Ron stared at Weasley. He knew that Ron could not be permitted to go and live with Weasleyatrix Weasley, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Ron, was repugnant.
"Give him an order," said Weasley. "If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress."
"Won't, won't, won’t, WON'T!"
Ron's voice had risen to a scream. Ron could think of nothing to say, except, "Ron, shut up!"
It looked for a moment as though Ron was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Ron whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.
"Well, that simplifies matters," said Weasley cheerfully. "It means that Ron knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Ron."
"Do I -- do I have to keep him with me?" Ron asked, aghast, us Ron thrashed around at his feet.
"Not if you don't want to," said Weasley. "If I might make ii suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him."
"Yeah," said Ron in relief, "yeah, I'll do that. Er -- Ron -- I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves."
Ron, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Ron one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.
"Good," said Weasley. "There is also the matter of the hip-pogriff, Ron. Weasley has been looking after him since Ron died, but Ron is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements --"
"No," said Ron at once, "he can stay with Weasley. I think Ron would prefer that."
"Weasley will be delighted," said Weasley, smiling. "He was thrilled to see Ron again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Ron's safety, to rechristen him 'Witherwings' for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now, Ron, is your trunk packed?"
Erm...
"Doubtful that I would turn up?" Weasley suggested shrewdly.
"I'll just go and -- er -- finish off," said Ron hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Ron's cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs,
He was disappointed to discover that Weasley was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room.
Nobody was talking. Weasley was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Ron did not dare look at the Weasleys as he said, "Professor -- I'm ready now."
"Good," said Weasley. "Just one last thing, then." And he turned to speak to the Weasleys once more.
"As you will no doubt be aware, Ron comes of age in a years time --"
"No," said Aunt Ron, speaking for the first time since Weasley's arrival.
"I'm sorry?" said Weasley politely.
"No, he doesn't. He's a month younger than Ron, and Dudders doesn't turn eighteen until the year after next."
"Ah," said Weasley pleasantly, "but in the Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen."
Uncle Vernoii muttered, "Preposterous," but Weasley ignored him,
"Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Weasley Was returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Ron, whom Lord Weasley has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents' murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him ;is though he were your own."
Weasley paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Ron felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Weasleys drew very slightly closer together.
"You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Ron as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you."
Both Aunt Ron and Uncle Ron looked around instinc-lively, as though expecting to see someone other than Ron squeezed between them.
"Us -- mistreat Dudders? What d'you -- ?" began Uncle Ron furiously, but Weasley raised his ringer for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Ron dumb.
"The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Ron has powerful protection while he can still call this house 'home.' However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Ron turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Ron to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time."
None of the Weasleys said anything. Ron was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated.
Uncle Ron looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Ron, however, was oddly flushed.
"Well, Ron... time for us to be off," said Weasley at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak. "Until we meet again," he said to the Weasleys, who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his hat, he swept from the room.
"Bye," said Ron hastily to the Weasleys, and followed Weasley, who paused beside Ron's trunk, upon which Ron's cage was perched.
"We do not want to be encumbered by these just now," he said, pulling out his wand again. "I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak... just in case."
Ron extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Weasley the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbiedore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Ron vanished. Weasley then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.
"And now, Ron, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure."
Chapter 4: Ron Weasley
Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that Weasley would indeed come to fetch him, Ron felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Ron's sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Weasley's most prized possessions.
Weasley, however, seemed completely relaxed.
"Keep your wand at the ready, Ron," he said brightly.
"But I thought I'm not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?"
"If there is an attack," said Weasley, "I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight."
"Why not, sir?"
"You are with me," said Weasley simply. "This will do, Ron."
He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
"You have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test," he said.
"No," said Ron. "I thought you had to be seventeen?"
"You do," said Weasley. "So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you don't mind -- as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment."
Ron gripped Weasley’s proffered forearm.
"Very good," said Weasley. "Well, here we go."
Ron felt Weasley’s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then ---
He gulped great lungfulls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished. He and Weasley were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His comprehension catching up with his senses, Ron realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life.
"Are you all right?" asked Weasley, looking down at him solicitously. "The sensation does take some getting used to."
"I'm fine," said Ron, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. "But I think I might prefer brooms..."
Weasley smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck, and said, "This way."
He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.
"So tell me, Ron," said Weasley. "Your scar... has it been hurting at all?"
Ron raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed i he lightning-shaped mark.
"No," he said, "and I've been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now Weasley's getting so powerful again."
He glanced up at Weasley and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.
"I, on the other hand, thought otherwise," said Weasley. "Lord Weasley has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and
feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you."
"Well, I'm not complaining," said Ron, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Weasley's mind.
They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Ron looked sideways at Weasley again. "Professor?"
"Ron?"
"Er -- where exactly are we?"
"This, Ron, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton."
"And what are we doing here?"
"Ah yes, of course, I haven't told you," said Weasley. "Well, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts."
"How can I help with that, sir?"
"Oh, I think we'll find a use for you," said Weasley vaguely. "Left here, Ron."
They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors, Ron cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.
"Professor, why couldn't we just Apparate directly into your old colleague's house?"
"Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door," said Weasley. "Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance --"
"-- you can't Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds," said Ron quickly. "Ron Weasley told me."
"And she is quite right. We turn left again."
The church clock chimed midnight behind them. Ron wondered why Weasley did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing questions to ask.
"Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Weasley has been sacked..."
"Correct," said Weasley, now turning up a steep side street. "He has been replaced, as ] am sure you also saw, by Ron Weasley, who used to be Head of the Auror office."
"Is he... Do you think he's good?" asked Ron.
"An interesting question," said Weasley. "He is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Ron."
"Yes, but I meant --"
"I know what you meant. Ron is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not under-estimate Lord Weasley."
Ron waited, but Weasley did not say anything about the disagreement with Weasley that the Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed ii. "And... sir... I saw about Ron Weasley."
"Yes," said Weasley quietly. "A terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think -- ouch."
He had pointed with his injured hand.
"Professor, what happened to your ... ?"
"I have no time to explain now," said Weasley. "It is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice."
He smiled at Ron, who understood that he was not being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep asking questions.
"Sir -- I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters..."
"Yes, I received one myself," said Weasley, still smiling. "Did you find it useful?"
"Not really."
"No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Weasley and not an impostor."
"I didn't..." Ron began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.
"For future reference, Ron, it is raspberry... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself."
"Er... right," said Ron. "Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn't very clear."
"They are corpses," said Weasley calmly. "Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard's bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Weasley was last powerful... He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Ron, just here..."
They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Ron was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate, Weasley stopped dead and Ron walked into him.
"Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear."
Ron followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. The front door was hanging off its hinges.
Weasley glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite deserted.
"Wand out and follow me, Ron," he said quietly.
He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Ron at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.
"Lumos."
Weasley's wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Weasley walked into the sitting room with Ron right behind him.
A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything. Weasley raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Ron's small intake of breath made Weasley look around.
"Not pretty, is it?" he said heavily. "Yes, something horrible has happened here."
Weasley moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Ron followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.
"Maybe there was a fight and -- and they dragged him off, Professor?" Ron suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.
"I don't think so," said Weasley quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side.
"You mean he's -- ?"
"Still here somewhere? Yes."
And without warning, Weasley swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, "Ouch!"
"Good evening, Ron," said Weasley, straightening up again.
Rons jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Weasley with an aggrieved and watery eye.
"There was no need to stick the wand in that hard," he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. "It hurt."
The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Weasley's chin.
"What gave it away?" he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.
"My dear Ron," said Weasley, looking amused, "if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house."
The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.
"The Dark Mark," he muttered. "Knew there was something... ah well. Wouldn't have had time anyway, I'd only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room."
He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter.
"Would you like my assistance clearing up?" asked Weasley politely.
"Please," said the other.
They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.
The furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments re-lormed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited; avast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering
across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.
"What kind of blood was that, incidentally?" asked Weasley loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock.
"On the walls? Dragon," shouted the wizard called Ron, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.
There was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.
"Yes, dragon," repeated the wizard conversationally. "My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment. Still, it might be reusable."
He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.
"Hmm. Bit dusty."
He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then that his gaze fell upon Ron.
"Oho," he said, his large round eyes flying to Ron's forehead and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. "Oho!"
"This," said Weasley, moving forward to make the introduction, "is Ron Weasley. Ron, this is an old Friend and colleague of mine, Ron Weasley."
Weasley turned on Weasley, his expression shrewd. "So that's how you thought you'd persuade me, is it? Well, the answer's no, Ron."
He pushed past Ron, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.
"I suppose we can have a drink, at least?" asked Weasley. "For old time's sake?"
Weasley hesitated.
"All right then, one drink," he said ungraciously.
Weasley smiled at Ron and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Weasley had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. Ron took the seat with the distinct impression that Weasley, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible as possible. Certainly when Weasley, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Ron.
"Hmpf," he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. "Here --" He gave a drink to Weasley, who had sat down without
invitation, thrust the tray at Ron, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.
"Well, how have you been keeping, Ron?" Weasley asked.
"Not so well," said Weasley at once. "Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can't move like I used to. Well, that's to be expected. Old age. Ronigue."
"And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice," said Weasley. "You can't have had more than three minutes' warning?"
Weasley said, half irritably, half proudly, "Two. Didn't hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath. Still," he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, "the fact remains that I'm an old man, Ron. A tired old man who's earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts."
He certainly had those, thought Ron, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Ron had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.
"You're not yet as old as I am, Ron," said Weasley.
"Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself," said Weasley bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Weasley's injured hand. "Reactions not what they were, I see."
"You're quite right," said Weasley serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Ron's neck prickle unpleasantly. "1 am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand..."
He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Ron noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Weasley wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Weasley's eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Ron saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.
"So, all these precautions against intruders, Ron... are they for the Death Eaters' benefit, or mine?" asked Weasley.
"What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me?" demanded Weasley.
"I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder," said Weasley. "Are you really telling me that they haven't come recruiting yet?"
Weasley eyed Weasley balefully for a moment, then muttered, "I haven't given them the chance. I've been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Mug-gle house to Muggle house -- the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands -- it's been very pleasant, I'll be sorry to leave. It's quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneako-scopes and make sure the neighbors don't spot you bringing in the piano."
"Ingenious," said Weasley. "But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts --"
"If you're going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your breath, Ron! I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Ron Weasley left! If that's how you treat teachers these days --"
"Professor Weasley ran afoul of our centaur herd," said Weasley. "I think you, Ron, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs 'filthy half-breeds.'"
"That's what she did, did she?" said Weasley. "Idiotic woman. Never liked her."
Ron chuckled and both Weasley and Weasley looked round at him.
"Sorry," Ron said hastily. "It's just -- I didn't like her either."
Weasley stood up rather suddenly.
"Are you leaving?" asked Weasley at once, looking hopeful.
"No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom," said Weasley.
"Oh," said Weasley, clearly disappointed. "Second on the left down the hall."
Weasley strode from the room. Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence. After a few moments, Weasley got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive look at Ron, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide behind.
"Don't think I don't know why he's brought you," he said abruptly.
Ron merely looked at Weasley. Weasley's watery eyes slid over Ron's scar, this time taking in the rest of his face.
"You look very like your father."
"Yeah, I've been told," said Ron.
"Except for your eyes. You've got ---"
"My mother's eyes, yeah." Ron had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing.
"Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn't have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother," Weasley added, in answer to Rons questioning look. "Ron Weasley. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too."
"Which was your House?"
"I was Head of Weasley," said Weasley. "Oh, now," he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Ron's face and wagging a stubby ringer at him, "don't go holding that against me! You'll be Weasley like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Ron Weasley? You must have done -- been in the papers for the last couple of years -- died a few weeks ago --"
It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Ron's intestines and held them tight.
"Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father's at school. The whole Weasley family had been in my House, but Ron ended up in Weasley! Shame -- he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Ron, when he came along, but I'd have liked the set."
He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.
"Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn't believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good."
"One of my best friends is Muggle-born," said Ron, "and she's the best in our year."
"Funny how that sometimes happens, isn't it?" said Weasley.
"Not really," said Ron coldly.
Weasley looked down at him in surprise. "You mustn't think I'm prejudiced!" he said. "No, no, no! Haven't I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students? And there was Ron Weasley in the year after her too -- now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course -- another Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at Gringotts!"
He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.
"All ex-students, all signed. You'll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he's always interested to hear my take on the day's news. And
Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes -- a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkisss who gave him his first job! And at the back -- you'll see her if you just crane your neck -- that's Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies... People are always astonished to hear I'm on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!"
This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.
"And all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff?" asked Ron, who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Weasley if hampers of sweets, Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him.
The smile slid from Weasley's face as quickly as the blood from his walls.
"Of course not," he said, looking down at Ron. "I have been out of touch with everybody for a year."
Ron had the impression that the words shocked Weasley himself; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged.
"Still... the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Weasley to talk, but taking up a post at Hog-warts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the
Phoenix! And while I'm sure they're very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don't personally fancy the mortality rate --"
"You don't have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts," said Ron, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to sympathize with Weasley's cosseted existence when he remembered Ron, crouching in a cave and living on rats. "Most of the teachers aren't in it, and none of them has ever been killed -- well, unless you count Weasley, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Weasley."
Ron had been sure Weasley would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Weasley's name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Weasley gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Ron ignored.
"I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumble-dore's headmaster; he's supposed to be the only one Weasley ever feared, isn't he?" Ron went on.
Weasley gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to be thinking over Ron's words.
"Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has never sought a fight with Weasley," he muttered grudgingly. "And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Kilters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend... in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Ron... I cannot pretend that Ron Weasley's death did not shake me... If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection..."
Weasley reentered the room and Weasley jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house.
"Oh, there you are, Ron," he said. "You've been a very long lime. Upset stomach?"
"No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines," said Weasley. "I do love knitting patterns. Well, Ron, we have trespassed upon Ron's hospitality quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave."
Not at all reluctant to obey, Ron jumped to his feet. Weasley sinned taken aback.
"You're leaving?"
"Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one."
"Lost...?"
Weasley seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Weasley fasten his traveling cloak, and Ron zip up his jacket.
"Well, I'm sorry you don't want the job, Ron," said Weasley, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. "Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to."
"Yes... well... very gracious... as I say..."
"Good-bye, then."
"Bye," said Ron.
They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.
"All right, all right, I'll do it!"
Weasley turned to see Weasley standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.
"You will come out of retirement?"
"Yes, yes," said Weasley impatiently. "I must be mad, but yes."
"Wonderful," said Weasley, beaming. "Then, Ron, we shall see you on the first of September."
"Yes, I daresay you will," grunted Weasley.
As they set off down the garden path, Weasley's voice floated after them, "I'll want a pay rise, Weasley!"
Weasley chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.
"Well done, Ron," said Weasley.
"I didn't do anything," said Ron in surprise.
"Oh yes you did. You showed Ron exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?"
"Er..."
Ron wasn't sure whether he liked Weasley or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born should make a good witch.
"Ron," said Weasley, relieving Ron of the responsibility to say any of this, "likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat -- more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Ron formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping
some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin liaison Office."
Ron had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.
"I tell you all this," Weasley continued, "not to turn you against Ron -- or, as we must now call him, Professor Weasley -- but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Ron. You would be the jewel of his collection; 'the Boy Who Lived'... or, as they call you these days, 'the Ronsen One.'"
At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Ron. He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survives...
Weasley had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier.
"This will do, Ron. If you will grasp my arm."
Braced this time, Ron was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Weasley and
looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there... and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew...
"If you don't mind, Ron," said Weasley, as they passed through the gate, "I'd like a few words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?"
Weasley pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Ron followed Weasley through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard. Weasley illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Ron.
"I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Ron, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Ron would have been proud of you."
Ron swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did not think he could stand to discuss Ron; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Ron say "His godfather's dead?" and even worse to hear Rons name thrown out casually by Weasley.
"It was cruel," said Weasley softly, "that you and Ron had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship."
Ron nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Weasley's hat. He could tell that Weasley understood, that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived, Ron had spent nearly all his time at the Weasleys' lying on his bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness i hat he had come to associate with dementors.
"It's just hard," Ron said finally, in a low voice, "to realize he won't write to me again."
His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather... and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again...
"Ron represented much to you that you had never known before," said Weasley gently. "Naturally, the loss is devastat-ing...
"But while I was at the Weasleys'..." interrupted Ron, his voice growing stronger, "I realized I cant shut myself away or -- or crack up. Ron wouldn't have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life's too short... Look at Ron Weasley, look at Ron Weasley... It could be me next, couldn't it?
But if it is," he said fiercely, now looking straight into Weasley's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, "I'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Weasley too if I can manage it."
"Spoken both like your mother and father's son and Ron's true godson!" said Weasley, with an approving pat on Ron's back. "I take my hat off to you -- or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders.
"And now, Ron, on a closely related subject... I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks?"
"Yes," said Ron, and his heart beat a little faster.
"Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?"
"Yes," said Ron again. "And now everyone knows that I'm the one --
"No, they do not," interrupted Weasley. "There are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Weasley, and they are both standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Weasley sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.
"Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?"
"No," said Ron.
"A wise decision, on the whole," said Weasley. "Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Ron Weasley. Yes," he continued, when Ron looked startled, "I think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them."
"I didn't want --"
"-- to worry or frighten them?" said Weasley, surveying Ron over the top of his half-moon spectacles. "Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need your friends, Ron. As you so rightly said, Ron would not have wanted you to shut yourself away."
Ron said nothing, but Weasley did not seem to require an answer. He continued, "On a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year."
"Private -- with you?" said Ron, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.
"Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education."
What will you be teaching me, sir?"
"Oh, a little of this, a little of that," said Weasley airily.
Ron waited hopefully, but Weasley did not elaborate, so ho asked something else that had been bothering him slightly.
"If I'm having lessons with you, I won't have to do Occlumency lessons with Weasley, will I?"
''Professor Weasley, Ron -- and no, you will not."
"Good," said Ron in relief, "because they were a --"
He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.
"I think the word 'fiasco' would be a good one here," said Weasley, nodding.
Ron laughed.
"Well, that means I won't see much of Professor Weasley from now on," he said, "because he won't let me carry on Potions unless I get 'Outstanding' in my OWL., which I know I haven't."
"Don't count your owls before they are delivered," said Weasley gravely. "Which, now I think of it, ought to be some time later today. Now, two more things, Ron, before we part.
"Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all i imes from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand me?"
Ron nodded.
"And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Ron and Ron -- all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them."
"I understand," said Ron quickly.
"Very well, then," said Weasley, pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. "I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Ron any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are."
Chapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm
Ron and Weasley approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Ron could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Weasley knocked three times and Ron saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.
"Who's there?" said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. Weasley's. "Declare yourself!"
"It is I, Weasley, bringing Ron."
The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown.
"Ron, dear! Gracious, Ron, you gave me a fright, you said not to expect you before morning!"
"We were lucky," said Weasley, ushering Ron over the threshold. "Weasley proved much more persuadable than I had expected. Ron's doing, of course. Ah, hello, Ron!"
Ron looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.
"Hello, Professor," she said. " Wotcher, Ron."
"Hi, Weasley."
Ron thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in her smile. Certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubble-gum-pink hair.
"I'd better be off," she said quickly, standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders. "Thanks for the tea and sympathy, Ron"
"Please don't leave on my account," said Weasley courteously, "I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Ron Weasley."
"No, no, I need to get going," said Weasley, not meeting Weasley's eyes. "'Night..."
"Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Ron and Mad-Eye are coming... ?"
"No, really, Ron... thanks anyway... Good night, every-one.
Weasley hurried past Weasley and Ron into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Ron noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.
"Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Ron," said Weasley. "Take care of yourself. Ron, your servant."
He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Weasley, vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Ron by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.
"You're like Ron," she sighed, looking him up and down. "Both of you look as though you've had Stretching jinxes put on you. I swear Ron's grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Ron?"
"Yeah, I am," said Ron, suddenly realizing just how hungry he was,
"Sit down, dear, I'll knock something up."
As Ron sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled there, purring.
"So Ron's here?" he asked happily as he tickled Ron behind the ears.
"Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday," said Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. "Everyone's in bed, of course, we didn't expect you for hours. Here you are..."
She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Ron, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in lime to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.
"Bread, dear?"
"Thanks, Mrs. Weasley."
She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him.
"So you persuaded Ron Weasley to take the job?"
Ron nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.
"He taught Ron and me," said Mrs. Weasley. "He was at Hog-warts for ages, started around the same time as Weasley, I think. Did you like him?"
His mouth now full of bread, Ron shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.
"I know what you mean," said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. "Of course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Ron's never liked him much. The Ministry's littered with Weasley's old favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had much time for Ron... didn't seem to think
he was enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Weasley makes mistakes. I don't know whether Ron's told you in any of his letters... it's only just happened... but Ron's been promoted!"
It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.
Ron swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering. "That's great!" he gasped.
"You are sweet," beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. "Yes, Ron Weasley has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Ron's heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It's a big job, he's got ten people reporting to him now!"
"What exactly?"
"Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thing... so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off... Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Ron Hotelier, who've never done an honest day's work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Ron confiscated a box
of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it's a very important job, and I tell him it's just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish." Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Ron suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.
"Is Mr. Weasley still at work?" Ron asked.
"Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he's a tiny bit late... He said he'd be back around midnight..."
She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Ron recognized it at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on i he Weasleys' sitting room wall, though its current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at "mortal peril."
"It's been like that for a while now," said Mrs. Weasley, in an un-convincingly casual voice, "ever since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I suppose everybody's in mortal danger now... I don't think it can be just our family... but I don't know anyone else who's got a clock like this, so I can't check. Oh!"
With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock's face. Mr. Weasley's hand had switched to "traveling."
"He's coming!"
And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly, "Ron, is that you?"
"Yes," came Mr. Weasley's weary voice. "But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!"
"Oh, honestly..."
"Ron!"
"All right, all right... What is your dearest ambition?"
"To find out how airplanes stay up."
Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side, because the door remained firmly shut.
"Ron! I've got to ask you your question first!"
"Ron, really, this is just silly..."
"What do you like me to call you when we're alone together?"
Even by the dim light of the lantern Ron could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.
"Ronwobbles," whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.
"Correct," said Mr. Weasley. "Now you can let me in."
Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak.
"I still don't see why we have to go through that every time you come home," said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. "I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!"
"I know, dear, but it's Ministry procedure, and I have to set an example. Something smells good... onion soup?"
Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.
"Ron! We didn't expect you until morning!"
They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Ron as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too.
"Thanks, Ron. It's been a tough night. Some idiot's started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them around your neck and you'll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons!"
"And what really happens when you put them on?"
"Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle like warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo's didn't have enough to do already!"
"It sounds like the sort of thing Ron and Ron would find funny," said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. "Are you sure... ?"
"Of course I am!" said Mr. Weasley. "The boys wouldn't do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!"
"So is that why you're late, Metamorph-Medals?"
"No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there..."
Ron stifled a yawn behind his hand.
"Bed," said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. "I've got Ron and Ron's room all ready for you, you'll have it to yourself."
"Why, where are they?"
"Oh, they're in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they're so busy," said Mrs. Weasley. "I must say, I didn't approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! Come on, dear, your trunks already up there."
"'Night, Mr. Weasley," said Ron, pushing back his chair. Ron leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room.
"G'night, Ron," said Mr. Weasley.
Ron saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were once again at "mortal peril."
Ron and Ron's bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Ron thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Ron's school
trunk. The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.
Ron hooted happily at Ron from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Ron knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Ron bade Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.
Seconds later, or so it seemed to Ron, he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other.
"Wuzzgoinon?"
"We didn't know you were here already!" said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head.
"Ron, don't hit him!" said a girl's voice reproachfully.
Ron's hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though I he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered
in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.
"All right?"
"Never been better," said Ron, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows. "You?"
"Not bad," said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. "When did you get here? Mum's only just told us!"
"About one o'clock this morning."
"Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?"
"Same as usual," said Ron, as Ron perched herself on the edge of his bed, "they didn't talk to me much, but I like it better that way. How're you, Ron?"
"Oh, I'm fine," said Ron, who was scrutinizing Ron as though he was sickening for something. He thought he knew what was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Ron's death or any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, "What's the time? Have I missed breakfast?"
"Don't worry about that, Mum's bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed," said Ron, rolling his eyes. "So, what's been going on?"
"Nothing much, I've just been stuck at my aunt and uncle's, haven't I?"
"Come off it!" said Ron. "You've been off with Weasley!"
"It wasn't that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement. His name's Ron Weasley."
"Oh," said Ron, looking disappointed. "We thought..."
Ron flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.
"...we thought it'd be something like that."
"You did?" said Ron, amused.
"Yeah... yeah, now Weasley has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don't we? So, er, what's he like?"
"He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of Weasley," said Ron. "Something wrong, Ron?"
She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. She rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile.
"No, of course not! So, um, did Weasley seem like he'll be a good teacher?"
"Dunno," said Ron. "He can't be worse than Weasley, can he?"
"I know someone who's worse than Weasley," said a voice from the doorway. Ron's younger sister slouched into the room, looking irritable. "Hi, Ron."
"What's up with you?" Ron asked.
"It's her," said Ron, plonking herself down on Ron's bed. "She's driving me mad."
"What's she done now?" asked Ron sympathetically.
"It's the way she talks to me... you'd think I was about three!"
"I know," said Ron, dropping her voice. "She's so full of herself."
Ron was astonished to hear Ron talking about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily, "Can't you two lay off her for five seconds?"
"Oh, that's right, defend her," snapped Ron. "We all know you can't get enough of her."
This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron's mother. Starting to feel that he was missing something, Ron said, "Who are you... ?"
But his question was answered before he could finish it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Ron instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Ron and Ron slid off the bed onto the floor.
A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.
"'Arry," she said in a throaty voice. "Eet 'as been too long!"
As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross.
"There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!"
"Eet was no trouble," said Ron Weasley, setting the tray across Ron's knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. "I 'ave been longing to see 'im. You remember my seester, Ron? She never stops talking about 'Arry Weasley. She will be delighted to see you again."
"Oh... is she here too?" Ron croaked.
"No, no, silly boy," said Ron with a tinkling laugh, "I mean next summer, when we... but do you not know?"
Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, "We hadn't got around to telling him yet."
Ron turned back to Ron, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.
"Ron and I are going to be married!"
"Oh," said Ron blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley, Ron, and Ron were all determinedly avoiding one another's gaze. "Wow. Er... congratulations!"
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
"Ron is very busy at ze moment, working very 'ard, and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me 'ere for a few days to get to know 'is family properly. I was so pleased to 'ear you would be coming... zere isn't much to do 'ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Well... enjoy your breakfast, 'Arry!"
With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.
Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like, "tchah!"
"Mum hates her," said Ron quietly.
"I do not hate her!" said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. "I just think they've hurried into this engagement, that's all!"
"They've known each other a year," said Ron, who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door.
"Well, that's not very long! I know why it's happened, of course. Its all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they're rushing all sorts of decisions they'd normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center..."
"Including you and Dad," said Ron slyly.
"Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting?" said Mrs. Weasley. "Whereas Ron and Ron... well... what have they really got in common? He's a hardworking, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she's..."
"A cow," said Ron, nodding. "But Ron's not that down-to-earth. He's a Curse-Breaker, isn't he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour... I expect that's why he's gone for Phlegm."
"Stop calling her that, Ron," said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Ron and Ron laughed. "Well, I'd better get on... Eat your eggs while they're warm, Ron."
Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water.
"Don't you get used to her if she's staying in the same house?" Ron asked.
"Well, you do," said Ron, "but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then..."
"It's pathetic," said Ron furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.
"You don't really want her around forever?" Ron asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, "Well, Mum's going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything."
"How's she going to manage that?" asked Ron.
"She keeps trying to get Weasley round for dinner. I think she's hoping Ron will fall for Weasley instead. I hope he does, I'd much rather have her in the family."
"Yeah, that'll work," said Ron sarcastically. "Listen, no bloke in his right mind's going to fancy Weasley when Ron's around. I mean, Weasley is okay-looking when she isn't doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, but..."
"She's a damn sight nicer than Phlegm? said Ron.
"And she's more intelligent, she's an Auror!" said Ron from the corner.
"Ron's not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament," said Ron.
"Not you as well!" said Ron bitterly.
"I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ' 'Any,' do you?" asked Ron scornfully.
"No," said Ron, wishing he hadn't spoken, "I was just saying, Phlegm... I mean, Ron..."
"I'd much rather have Weasley in the family," said Ron. "At least she's a laugh."
"She hasn't been much of a laugh lately," said Ron. "Every time I've seen her she's looked more like Moaning Ron."
"That's not fair," snapped Ron. "She still hasn't got over what happened... you know... I mean, he was her cousin!"
Ron's heart sank. They had arrived at Ron. He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.
"Weasley and Ron barely knew each other!" said Ron. "Ron was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met..."
"That's not the point," said Ron. "She thinks it was her limit he died!"
"How does she work that one out?" asked Ron, in spite of himself.
"Well, she was fighting Weasleyatrix Weasley, wasn't she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Weasleyatrix couldn't have killed Ron."
"That's stupid," said Ron.
"It's survivor's guilt," said Ron. "I know Weasley's tried to talk her round, but she's still really down. She's actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!"
"With her...?"
"She can't change her appearance like she used to," explained Ron. "I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something."
"I didn't know that could happen," said Ron.
"Nor did I," said Ron, "but I suppose if you're really depressed..."
The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in. "Ron," she whispered, "come downstairs and help me with the lunch."
"I'm talking to this lot!" said Ron, outraged.
"Now!" said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew.
"She only wants me there so she doesn't have to be alone with Phlegm!" said Ron crossly. She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Ron and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina.
"You lot had better come down quickly too," she said as she left.
Ron took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast. Ron was peering into Ron and Ron's boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Ron. Ron, who was now helping himself to Ron...s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.
"What's this?" Ron asked eventually, holding up what looked like a small telescope.
"Dunno," said Ron, "but if Ron and Ron left it here, it's probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful"
"Your mum said the shop's going well," said Ron. "Said Ron and Ron have got a real flair for business."
"That's an understatement," said Ron. "They're raking in the Galleons! I can't wait to see the place, we haven't been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dad's got to be there for extra security and he's been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent."
"And what about Ron?" asked Ron; the third-eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. "Is he talking to your mum and dad again?"
"Nope," said Ron.
"But he knows your dad was right all along now about Weasley being back..."
"Weasley says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right," said Ron. "I heard him telling your mum, Ron."
"Sounds like the sort of mental thing Weasley would say," said Ron.
"He's going to be giving me private lessons this year," said Ron conversationally.
Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Ron gasped.
"You kept that quiet!" said Ron.
"I only just remembered," said Ron honestly. "He told me last night in your broom shed."
"Blimey... private lessons with Weasley!" said Ron, looking impressed. "I wonder why he's... ?"
His voice tailed away. Ron saw him and Ron exchange looks. Ron laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed. Weasley had said to do it... Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap, and said, "I don't know exactly why he's going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy."
Neither Ron nor Ron spoke. Ron had the impression that both had frozen. He continued, still speaking to his fork, "You know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry."
"Nobody knows what it said, though," said Ron quickly. "It got smashed."
"Although the Prophet says..." began Ron, but Ron said, "Shh!"
"The Prophet's got it right," said Ron, looking up at them both with a great effort: Ron seemed frightened and Ron amazed. "That glass ball that smashed wasn't the only record of the prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Weasley's office, he was the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said," Ron took a deep breath, "it looks like I'm the one who's got to finish off Weasley... At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives."
The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Ron vanished behind a puff of black smoke.
"Ron!" shouted Ron and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.
Ron emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.
"I squeezed it and it... it punched me!" she gasped.
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.
"Don't worry," said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, "Mum'll fix that, she's good at healing minor injuries..."
"Oh well, never mind that now!" said Ron hastily. "Ron, oh, Ron..."
She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
"We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry... Obviously, we didn't want to say anything to you, but from what Ron Weasley said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Weasley, well, we thought it might be something like this... Oh, Ron..." She stared at him, then whispered, "Are you scared?"
"Not as much as I was," said Ron. "When I first heard it, I was... but now, it seems as though I always knew I'd have to face him in the end..."
"When we heard Weasley was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy," said Ron eagerly. "And we were kind of right, weren't we? He wouldn't be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn't waste his time... he must think you've got a chance!"
"That's true," said Ron. "I wonder what he'll teach you, Ron? Really advanced defensive magic, probably... powerful countercurses... anti-jinxes..."
Ron did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Ron were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.
"...and evasive enchantments generally," concluded Ron. "Well, at least you know one lesson you'll be having this year, that's one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our OWL results will come?"
"Cant be long now, it's been a month," said Ron.
"Hang on," said Ron, as another part of last night's conversation came back to him. "I think Weasley said our OWL results would be arriving today!"
"Today?" shrieked Ron. "Today? But why didn't you... oh my God... you should have said..."
She leapt to her feet.
"I'm going to see whether any owls have come..."
But when Ron arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find Ron sitting at the
kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.
"It just won't budge," Mrs. Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Ron with her wand in her hand and a copy of The Healer's Helpmate open at "Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions." "This has always worked before, I just can't understand it."
"It'll be Ron and Ron's idea of a funny joke, making sure it can't come off," said Ron.
"But it's got to come off!" squeaked Ron. "I can't go around looking like this forever!"
"You won't, dear, we'll find an antidote, don't worry," said Mrs. Weasley soothingly.
"Ron told me W Ron and Ron are very amusing!" said Ron, smiling serenely.
"Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing," snapped Ron.
She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.
"Mrs. Weasley, you're quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this morning?"
"Yes, dear, I'd have noticed," said Mrs. Weasley patiently. "But it's barely nine, there's still plenty of time..."
"I know I messed up Ancient Runes," muttered Ron feverishly, "I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking back..."
"Ron, will you shut up, you're not the only one who's nervous!" barked Ron. "And when you've got your eleven 'Outstanding OWLs...’"
"Don't, don't, don't!" said Ron, flapping her hands hysterically. "I know I've failed everything!"
"What happens if we fail?" Ron asked the room at large, but it was again Ron who answered.
"We discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor Weasley at the end of last term."
Ron's stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten less breakfast.
"At Beauxbatons," said Ron complacently, "we 'ad a different way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then..."
Ron's words were drowned in a scream. Ron was pointing through the kitchen window. Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time.
"They're definitely owls," said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Ron at the window.
"And there are three of them," said Ron, hastening to her other side.
"One for each of us," said Ron in a terrified whisper. "Oh no... oh no... oh no..."
She gripped both Ron and Ron tightly around the elbows.
The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.
"Oh no!" squealed Ron.
Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.
Ron moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron
was trying to detach his own results; to his right, Ron's hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble.
Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Ron managed to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside.
Ordinary Wizarding Level Results
Pass Grades:
Outstanding (O)
Exceeds Expectations (E)
Acceptable (A)
Fail Grades:
Poor (P)
Dreadful (D)
Troll (T)
Ron Ron Weasley has achieved:
Astronomy A
Care of Magical Creatures E
Charms E
Defense Against the Dark Arts O
Divination P
Herbology E
History of Magic D
Potions E
Transfiguration E
Ron read the parchment through several times, his breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was all right: He had always known that he would fail Divination, and he had had no chance of passing History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination, but he had passed everything else! He ran his finger down the grades... he had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology, he had even exceeded
expectations at Potions! And best of all, he had achieved "Outstanding" at Defense Against the Dark Arts!
He looked around. Ron had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.
"Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares about them?" he said happily to Ron. "Here... swap..."
Ron glanced down Ron's grades: There were no "Outstandings" there...
"Knew you'd be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts," said Ron, punching Ron on the shoulder. "We've done all right, haven't we?"
"Well done!" said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron's hair. "Seven OWLs, that's more than Ron and Ron got together!"
"Ron?" said Ron tentatively, for Ron still hadn't turned around. "How did you do?"
"I--not bad," said Ron in a small voice.
"Oh, come off it," said Ron, striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. "Yep... ten 'Outstandings' and one 'Exceeds Expectations' at Defense Against the Dark Arts." He looked down at her, half-amused, half-exasperated. "You're actually disappointed, aren't you?"
Ron shook her head, but Ron laughed.
"Well, we're N.E.W.T. students now!" grinned Ron. "Mum, are there any more sausages?"
Ron looked back down at his results. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of regret... This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he wouldn't, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E.
It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Ron he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn't really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago... Neither can live while the other survives...Wouldn't he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Weasley?
Chapter 6: Ron's Detour
Ron remained within the confines of the Burrow's garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys' orchard (he and Ron against Ron and Ron; Ron was dreadful and Ron good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.
It would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for the stones of disappearances, odd accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Ron and Mr. Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure, Ron's sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Ron Weasley, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.
"There have been another couple of dementor attacks," he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake. "And they've found Ron Weasley's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it... well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters; Ron's brother, Ron, only managed a few days as far as I can remember."
"Yes, well," said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, "perhaps we should talk about something diff..."
"Did you hear about Ron Weasley, Ron?" asked Ron, who was being plied with wine by Ron. "The man who ran..."
"Is the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?" Ron interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. "He used to give me free ice creams. What's happened to him?"
"Dragged off, by the look of his place."
"Why?" asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Ron.
"Who knows? He must've upset them somehow. He was a good man, Ron."
"Talking of Diagon Alley," said Mr. Weasley, "looks like Weasley's gone too."
"The wandmaker?" said Ron, looking startled.
"That's the one. Shop's empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped."
"But what'll people do for wands?"
"They'll make do with other makers," said Weasley. "But Weasley was the best, and if the other side have got him it's not so good for us."
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Ron's included a surprise: he had been made Quidditch Captain.
"That gives you equal status with prefects!" cried Ron happily. "You can use our special bathroom now and everything!"
"Wow, I remember when Ron wore one of these," said Ron, examining the badge with glee. "Ron, this is so cool, you're my Captain... if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha..."
"Well, I don't suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you've got these," sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Ron...s booklist. "We'll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn't have to go into work again. I'm not going there without him."
"Mum, d'you honestly think You-Know-Who's going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?" sniggered Ron.
"Weasley and Weasley went on holiday, did they?" said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. "If you think security's a laughing matter you can stay behind and I'll get your things myself..."
"No, I wanna come, I want to see Ron and Ron's shop!" said Ron hastily.
"Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide you're too immature to come with us!" said Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing at "mortal peril," and balancing it on top of a pile of just-laundered towels. "And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!"
Ron turned to stare incredulously at Ron as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room.
"Blimey... you can't even make a joke round here anymore..."
But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Weasley over the next few days. Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Ron, who would be staying at home with Ron (much to Ron and Ron's pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Ron.
"Where's mine?" demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide.
"That's already Ron's, idiot," said Ron. "I got it out of your vault for you, Ron, because it's taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago
Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his... Well, trust me, this way's easier."
"Thanks, Ron," said Ron, pocketing his gold.
"E is always so thoughtful," purred Ron adoringly, stroking Ron's nose. Ron mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Ron. Ron choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.
It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Ron had ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks.
"It's good Dad can get us these again," said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Ron and Ron waving from the kitchen window. He, Ron, Ron, and Ron were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.
"Don't get used to it, it's only because of Ron," said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa. "He's been given top-grade security status. And we'll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too."
Ron said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good enough for Weasley, it ought
to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak.
"Here you are, then," said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. "I'm to wait for you, any idea how long you'll be?"
"A couple of hours, I expect," said Mr. Weasley. "Ah, good, he's here!"
Ron imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Ron Weasley, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Ron's face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.
"Ron!" he boomed, sweeping Ron into a bone-crushing hug the moment Ron had stepped out of the car. "Ron... Witherwings, I mean... yeh should see him, Ron, he's so happy ter be back in the open air..."
"Glad he's pleased," said Ron, grinning as he massaged his ribs. "We didn't know 'security' meant you!"
"I know, jus' like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o' Aurors, but Weasley said I'd do," said Weasley proudly, throwing
out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. "Lets get goin' then... after yeh, Ron, Ron..."
The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Ron's memory, completely empty. Only Ron the landlord, wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he could speak, Weasley said importantly, "Jus' passin' through today, Ron, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know."
Ron nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Ron, Ron, Weasley, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. Weasley raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Weasleyatrix Weasley was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Ron Weasley's Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one,
which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front:
AMULETS
Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi!
A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.
"One for your little girl, madam?" he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leering at Ron. "Protect her pretty neck?"
"If I were on duty..." said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.
"Yes, but don't go arresting anyone now, dear, we're in a hurry," said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a list. "I think we'd better do Ron Weasley's first, Ron wants new dress robes, and Ron's showing much too much ankle in his school robes, and you must need new ones too, Ron, you've grown so much... come on, everyone..."
"Ron, it doesn't make sense for all of us to go to Ron Weasley's," said Mr. Weasley. "Why don't those three go with Weasley, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone's school-books?"
"I don't know," said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack. "Weasley, do you think...- ?"
"Don't fret, they'll be fine with me, Ron," said Weasley soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ron while Ron, Ron, Ron, and Weasley set off for Ron Weasley's.
Ron noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.
"Migh' be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us," said Weasley, stopping outside Ron Weasley's and bending down to peer through the window. "I'll stand guard outside, all right?"
So Ron, Ron, and Ron entered the little shop together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.
"... not a child, in case you haven't noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone."
There was a clucking noise and a voice Ron recognized as that of Ron Weasley, the owner, said, "Now, dear, your mother's quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, it's nothing to do with being a child..."
"Watch where you're sticking that pin, will you!"
A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Ron, Ron, and Ron reflected over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed.
"If you're wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in," said Ron Weasley.
"I don't think there's any need for language like that!" said Ron Weasley, scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. "And I don't want wands drawn in my shop either!" she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown her Ron and Ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at Weasley. Ron, who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, "No, don't, honestly, it's not worth it. "
"Yeah, like you'd dare do magic out of school," sneered Weasley. "Who blacked your eye, Weasley? I want to send them flowers."
"That's quite enough!" said Ron Weasley sharply, looking over her shoulder for support. "Ron, please!"
Ron Weasley strolled out from behind the clothes rack.
"Put those away," she said coldly to Ron and Ron. "If you at-tack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do."
"Really?" said Ron, taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sister's. He was as tall as she was now. "Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?"
Ron Weasley squealed and clutched at her heart.
"Really, you shouldn't accuse... dangerous thing to say... wands away, please!"
But Ron did not lower his wand. Ron Weasley smiled unpleasantly.
"I see that being Weasley's favorite has given you a false sense of security, Ron Weasley. But Weasley won't always be there to protect you."
Ron looked mockingly all around the shop. "Wow... look at that... he's not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!"
Weasley made an angry movement toward Ron, but stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly.
"Don't you dare talk to my mother like that, Weasley!" Weasley snarled.
"It's all right, Ron," said Ron, restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. "I expect Weasley will be reunited with dear Ron before I am reunited with Ron."
Ron raised his wand higher.
"Ron, no!" moaned Ron, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side. "Think... You mustn't... You'll be in such trouble..."
Ron Weasley dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn't. She bent toward Weasley, who was still glaring at Ron.
"I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me just..."
"Ouch!" bellowed Weasley, slapping her hand away. "Watch where you're putting your pins, woman! Mother, I don't think I want these anymore."
He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Ron Weasley's feet.
"You're right, Ron," said Ron, with a contemptuous glance at Ron, "now I know the kind of scum that shops here... We'll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting's."
And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Weasley taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.
"Well, really? said Ron Weasley, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust.
She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron's and Ron's new robes, tried to sell Ron wizard's dress robes instead of witch's, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them.
"Got ev'rything?" asked Weasley brightly when they reappeared at his side.
"Just about," said Ron. "Did you see the Weasleys?"
"Yeah," said Weasley, unconcerned. "Bu they wouldn... dare make trouble in the middle o' Diagon Alley, Ron. Don' worry abou1 them."
Ron, Ron, and Ron exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse Weasley of this comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ron appeared, all clutching heavy packages of books.
"Everyone all right?" said Mrs. Weasley. "Got your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Ron and Ron's... stick close, now..."
Neither Ron nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Ron and Ron at Eeylops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every minute or so, they headed farther along the street in search of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Ron and Ron.
"We really haven't got too long," Mrs. Weasley said. "So we'll just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be close, that's number ninety-two... ninety-four..."
"Whoa,"said Ron, stopping in his tracks.
Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop Fronts around them, Ron and Rons windows hit the eye like a firework display. Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a halt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Rons eyes began to water just looking at it. The right-hand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:
WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT
YOU-KNOW-WHO?
YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT
U-NO-POO--
THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION
THAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION!
Ron started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name "U-No-Poo."
"They'll be murdered in their beds!" she whispered.
"No they won’t!" said Ron, who, like Ron, was laughing. "This is brilliant!"
And he and Ron led the way into the shop. It was packed with customers; Ron could not get near the shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Ron noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Ron pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: Reusable hangman - spell it or he'll swing!
"Patented Daydream Charms"
Ron had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.
"One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens. You know," said Ron, looking up at Ron, "that really is extraordinary magic!"
"For that, Ron," said a voice behind them, "you can have one for free."
A beaming Ron stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.
"How are you, Ron?" They shook hands. "And what's happened to your eye, Ron?"
Your punching telescope," she said ruefully.
"Oh blimey, I forgot about those," said Ron. "Here..."
He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste.
"Just dab it on, that bruise'll be gone within the hour," said Ron. "We had to find a decent bruise remover. We're testing most of our products on ourselves."
Ron looked nervous. "It is safe, isn't it?" she asked.
"Course it is," said Ron bracingly. "Come on, Ron, I'll give you a tour."
Ron left Ron dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Ron toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks.
"Muggle magic tricks!" said Ron happily, pointing them out. "For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It's not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they're great novelties... Oh, here's Ron..."
Ron's twin shook Rons hand energetically.
"Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Ron, that's where we're making the real money...pocket anything, you, and you'll pay in more than Galleons!" he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled:
EDIBLE DARK MARKS----THEY'LL MAKE ANYONE SICK!
Ron pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Ron saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued.
"We've just developed this more serious line," said Ron. "Funny how it happened..."
"You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm," said Ron. "'Course, they didn't have you teaching them, Ron."
"That's right... Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!"
"So we've expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves..."
"... I mean, they wouldn't help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes..."
"And then we thought we'd get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it's such a money spinner," continued Ron enthusiastically. "This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we're importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a quick escape."
"And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look," said Ron, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. "You just drop one surreptitiously and it'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.
"Handy," said Ron, impressed.
"Here," said Ron, catching a couple and throwing them to Ron.
A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Ron saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes.
"There's a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley," she said.
Ron found it very odd to hear Ron and Ron called "Mr. Weasley," but they took it in their stride.
"Right you are, Verity, I'm coming," said Ron promptly. "Ron, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No charge."
"I can't do that!" said Ron, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators.
"You don't pay here," said Ron firmly, waving away Ron's gold.
"But..."
"You gave us our start-up loan, we haven't forgotten," said Ron sternly "Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask."
Ron swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Ron led Ron back into the main part of the shop to find Ron and Ron still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms.
"Haven't you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?" asked Ron. "Follow me, ladies..."
Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Ron and Ron both hung back, looking wary.
"There you go," said Ron proudly. "Best range of love potions you'll find anywhere."
Ron raised an eyebrow skeptically. "Do they work?" she asked.
"Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question..."
"... and the attractiveness of the girl," said Ron, reappearing suddenly at their side. "But we're not selling them to our sister," he added, becoming
suddenly stern, "not when she's already got about five boys on the go from what we've..."
"Whatever you've heard from Ron is a big fat lie," said Ron calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf. "What's this?"
"Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher," said Ron. "Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads, but don't change the subject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Ron Ron?"
"Yes, I am," said Ron. "And last time I looked, he was definitely one boy, not five. What are those?"
She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks.
"Pygmy Puffs," said Ron. "Miniature puffskeins, we can...t breed them fast enough. So what about Ron Weasley?"
"I dumped him, he was a bad loser," said Ron, putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. "They're really cute!"
"They're fairly cuddly, yes," conceded Ron. "But you're moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?"
Ron turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face that Ron was surprised Ron didn't recoil.
"It's none of your business. And I'll thank you'' she added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at Ron's elbow, laden with merchandise, "not to tell tales about me to these two!"
"That's three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut," said Ron, examining the many boxes in Ron's arms. "Cough up."
"I'm your brother!"
"And that's our stuff you're nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I'll knock off the Knut."
"But I haven't got three Galleons, nine Sickles!"
"You'd better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves."
Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Ron that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear.
"If I see you do that again I'll jinx your fingers together," she said sharply.
"Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?" said Ron at once.
"A what?" said Mrs. Weasley warily.
"Look, they're so sweet..."
Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Ron, Ron, and Ron momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. Ron Weasley was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him.
"Wonder where his mummy is?" said Ron, frowning.
"Given her the slip by the looks of it," said Ron.
"Why, though?" said Ron.
Ron said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Ron Weasley would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Weasley must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.
Ron, knowing and loathing Weasley, was sure the reason could not be innocent.
He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ron were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Ron and Ron were both helping customers. On the
other side of the glass, Weasley was standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street.
"Get under here, quick," said Ron, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.
"Oh, I don't know, Ron," said Ron, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley.
"Come on," said Ron.
She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with Ron and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Ron and Ron's products. Ron, Ron, and Ron squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Weasley had disappeared just as successfully as they had.
"He was going in that direction," murmured Ron as quietly as possible, so that the humming Weasley would not hear them...Cmon...
They scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Ron pointed ahead.
"That's him, isn't it?" she whispered. "Turning left?"
"Big surprise," whispered Ron.
For Weasley had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight.
"Quick, or we'll lose him," said Ron, speeding up.
"Our feet'll be seen!" said Ron anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays.
"It doesn't matter," said Ron impatiently. "Just hurry!"
But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Ron supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts... or at least, to be seen buying them.
Ron gave his arm a hard pinch.
"Ouch!"
"Shh! Look! He's in there!" she breathed in Ron's ear.
They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Ron had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood Ron Weasley with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large
black cabinet in which Ron had once hidden to avoid Weasley and his father. Judging by the movements of Weasley's hands, he was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facing Weasley. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.
"If only we could hear what they're saying!" said Ron.
"We can!" said Ron excitedly. "Hang on, damn."
He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest.
"Extendable Ears, look!"
"Fantastic!" said Ron, as Ron unraveled the long, flesh-colored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door. "Oh, I hope the door isn't Imperturbable..."
"No!" said Ron gleefully. "Listen!"
They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings, through which Weasley's voice could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had been turned on.
"... you know how to fix it?"
"Possibly," said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. "I'll need to see it, though. Why don't you bring it into the shop?"
"I can't," said Weasley. "It's got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it."
Ron saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.
"Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn't guarantee anything."
"No?" said Weasley, and Ron knew, just by his tone, that Weasley was sneering. "Perhaps this will make you more confident."
He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Ron, Ron, and Ron shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.
"Tell anyone," said Maifoy, "and there will be retribution. You know Ron Weasley? He's a family friend. He'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you're giving the problem your full attention."
"There will be no need for..."
"I'll decide that," said Weasley. "Well, I'd better be off. And don't forget to keep that one safe, I'll need it."
"Perhaps you'd like to take it now?"
"No, of course I wouldn't, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don't sell it."
"Of course not... sir."
Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Ron had once seen him give Ron Weasley.
"Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?"
"Naturally, naturally," murmured Borgin, bowing again.
Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Weasley stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Ron, Ron, and Ron that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried.
"What was that about?" whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.
"Dunno," said Ron, thinking hard. "He wants something mended... and he wants to reserve something in there... Could you see what he pointed at when he said 'that one'?"
"No, he was behind that cabinet..."
"You two stay here," whispered Ron.
"What are you... ?"
But Ron had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Ron.
"Hello, horrible morning, isn't it?" Ron said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Ron strolled through the jumble of objects on display.
"Is this necklace for sale?" she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case.
"If you've got one and a half thousand Galleons," said Mr. Borgin coldly.
"Oh... er... no, I haven't got quite that much," said Ron, walking on. "And... what about this lovely... um... skull?"
"Sixteen Galleons."
"So it's for sale, then? It isn't being... kept for anyone?"
Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Ron had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Ron was up to. Apparently Ron felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds.
"The thing is, that... er... boy who was in here just now, Ron Weasley, well, he's a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he's already reserved anything, I obviously don't want to get him the same thing, so... um..."
It was a pretty lame story in Ron's opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.
"Out," he said sharply. "Get out!"
Ron did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign.
"Ah well," said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Ron. "Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious..."
"Well, next time you can show me how it's done, Master of Mystery!" she snapped.
Ron and Ron bickered all the way back to Weasleys'
Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Weasley, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Ron whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasleys accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly.
Chapter 7: The Slug Club
Ron spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Weasley's behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Weasley's face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Weasley look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Ron seemed quite as curious about Weasley's activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.
"Yes, I've already agreed it was fishy, Ron," said Ron a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Ron and Ron's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. "But haven't we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?"
"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's bent tail twigs. "Remember that shriveled-up arm Weasley had?"
"But what about when he said, 'Don't forget to keep that one safe'?" asked Ron for the umpteenth time. "That sounded to me like Borgin's got another one of the broken objects, and Weasley wants both."
"You reckon?" said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.
"Yeah, I do," said Ron. When neither Ron nor Ron answered, he said, "Weasley's father's in Azkaban. Don't you think Weasley’d like revenge?"
Ron looked up, blinking.
"Weasley, revenge? What can he do about it?"
"That's my point, I don't know!" said Ron, frustrated. "But he's up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father's a Death Eater and ..."
Ron broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Ron, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him.
"Ron?" said Ron in an anxious voice. "What's wrong?"
"Your scar's not hurting again, is it?" asked Ron nervously.
"He's a Death Eater," said Ron slowly. "He's replaced his father as a Death Eater!"
There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. "Weasley? He's sixteen, Ron! You think You-Know-Who would let Weasley join?"
"It seems very unlikely, Ron," said Ron in a repressive sort of voice. "What makes you think ... ?"
"In Ron Weasley's. She didn't touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He's been branded with the Dark Mark."
Ron and Ron looked at each other.
"Well..." said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.
"I think he just wanted to get out of there, Ron," said Ron.
"He showed Borgin something we couldn't see," Ron pressed on stubbornly. "Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it... he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!"
Ron and Ron exchanged another look.
"I'm not sure, Ron..."
"Yeah, I still don't reckon You-Know-Who would let Weasley join..."
Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Ron snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ron, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.
"I wouldn't go in the kitchen just now," she warned him. "There's a lot of Phlegm around."
"I'll be careful not to slip in it." Ron smiled.
Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Ron sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Ron, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, looking bad-tempered.
"... Ron and I 'ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ron and Ron will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold, pink would of course be 'orrible with Ron's 'air!"
"Ah, Ron!" said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Ron's monologue. "Good, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We've got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station."
"Is Weasley going to be there?" asked Ron, handing over his Quidditch things.
"No, I don't think so, she's been stationed somewhere else from what Ron said."
"She has let 'erself go, zat Weasley," Ron mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. "A big mistake if you ask."
"Yes, thank you," said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Ron again. "You'd better get on, Ron, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don't have the usual last-minute scramble."
And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Ron's cat, Ron, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Ron; Ron's owl, Pig-widgeon; and Ron's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.
"Au revoir, 'Any," said Ron throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ron stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Ron's feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying good-bye.
There was no cheerful Weasley waiting for them at King's Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking.
"Quick, quick, through the barrier," said Mrs. Weasley, who
seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. "Ron had better go first, with..."
She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Ron's upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
"I can walk, thanks," said Ron irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror's grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.
Ron and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Ron motioned to Ron and Ron to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.
"We can't, Ron," said Ron, looking apologetic. "Ron and I've got to go to the prefects' carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit."
"Oh yeah, I forgot," said Ron.
"You'd better get straight on the train, all of you, you've only got a few minutes to go," said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch. "Well, have a lovely term, Ron..."
"Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?" said Ron, making up his mind on the spur of the moment.
"Of course," said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Ron out of earshot of the others nevertheless.
Ron had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly,
because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.
He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.
"When we were in Diagon Alley," Ron began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace.
"Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Ron disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Ron and Ron's shop?"
"How did you...?"
"Ron, please. You're talking to the man who raised Ron and Ron."
"Er... yeah, all right, we weren't in the back room." "Very well, then, let's hear the worst."
"Well, we followed Ron Weasley. We used my Invisibility Cloak."
"Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?"
"Because I thought Weasley was up to something," said Ron, disregarding Mr. Weasley's look of mingled exasperation and amusement. "He'd given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why."
"Of course you did," said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned. "Well? Did you find out why?"
"He went into Borgin and Burkes," said Ron, "and started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. And..."
Ron took a deep breath.
"There's something else. We saw Weasley jump about a mile when Ron Weasley tried to touch his left arm. I think he's been branded with the Dark Mark. 1 think he's replaced his father as a Death Eater."
Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, "Ron, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-year-old..."
"Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn't do?" asked Ron angrily. "Mr. Weasley, I'm sorry, but isn't it worth investigating? If Weasley wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it's probably something Dark or dangerous, isn't it?"
"I doubt it, to be honest, Ron," said Mr. Weasley slowly. "You see, when Ron Weasley was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous." "I think you missed something," said Ron stubbornly. "Well, maybe," said Mr. Weasley, but Ron could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him.
There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing.
"You'd better hurry!' said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, "Ron, quickly!"
He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train.
"Now, dear, you're coming to us for Christmas, it's all fixed with Weasley, so we'll see you quite soon," said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Ron slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. "You make sure you look after yourself and..."
The train was gathering speed.
"...be good and..." , She was jogging to keep up now.
"...stay safe!"
Ron waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Ron were cloistered in the prefects' carriage, but Ron was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.
People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the "Ronsen One" rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ron on the shoulder.
"Fancy trying to find a compartment?"
"I can't, Ron, I said I'd meet Ron," said Ron brightly. "See you later."
"Right," said Ron. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ron did not hang around with him, Ron, and Ron while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.
"Hi, Ron!" said a familiar voice from behind him.
"Ron!" said Ron in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.
"Hello, Ron," said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Ron.
"Ron, hi, how are you?"
"Very well, thank you," said Ron. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.
"Quibbler still going strong, then?" asked Ron, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.
"Oh yes, circulation's well up," said Ron happily.
"Let's find seats," said Ron, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Ron hurried inside gratefully.
"They're even staring at us? said Ron, indicating himself and Ron. "Because we're with you!"
"They're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too," said Ron, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. "Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must've
seen it."
"Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity," said Ron, "but she was really pleased. Says I'm starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!"
He pulled it out and showed it to Ron.
"Cherry and unicorn hair," he said proudly. "We think it was one of the last Weasley ever sold, he vanished next day ... oi, come back here, Ron!"
And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.
"Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Ron?" asked Ron,
who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.
"No point now we've got rid of Weasley, is there?" said Ron, sitting down. Ron bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.
"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!"
"I enjoyed the meetings too," said Ron serenely. "It was like having friends."
This was one of those uncomfortable things Ron often said and which made Ron feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.
"You ask him!"
No, you!
"I'll do it!"
And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.
"Hi, Ron, I'm Ron, Ron Weasley," she said loudly and confidently. "Why don't you join us in our compartment? You don't have to sit with them," she added in a stage whisper, indicating Ron's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Ron, and Ron, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.
"They're friends of mine," said Ron coldly.
"Oh," said the girl, looking very surprised. "Oh. Okay."
And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.
"People expect you 10 have cooler friends than us," said Ron, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.
"You are cool," said Ron shortly. "None of them was at the Ministry. They didn't fight with me."
"That's a very nice thing to say," beamed Ron. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The
Quibbler.
"We didn't face him, though," said Ron, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking Ron in his hand. "You did. You should hear my gran talk about you. 'That Ron Weasley's got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!' She'd give anything to have you as a grand-son...
Ron laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could. While Ron recited his grades and wondered aloud
whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration Ron, with only an "Acceptable," Ron watched him without really listening.
Ron's childhood had been blighted by Weasley just as much as Ron's had, but Ron had no idea how close he had come to having Ron's destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Weasley had chosen to believe that Ron was the one meant.
Had Weasley chosen Ron, it would be Ron sitting opposite Ron bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy... Or would it? Would Ron’s mother have died to save him, as Ron had died for Ron? Surely she would... But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Weasley? Would there then have been no "Ronsen One" at all? An empty seat where Ron now sat and a scarless Ron who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's?
"You all right, Ron? You look funny," said Ron.
Ron started. "Sorry ... I ..."
"Wrackspurt got you?" asked Ron sympathetically, peering at Ron through her enormous colored spectacles.
"I... what?"
"A Wrackspurt... They're invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy," she said. "I thought I felt one zooming around in here."
She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Ron and Ron caught each other's eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.
The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Ron entered the compartment at last.
"Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I'm starving," said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Ron and rubbing his stomach. "Hi, Ron. Hi, Ron. Guess what?" he added, turning to Ron. "Weasley s not doing prefect duty. He's just sitting in his compartment with the other Weasleys, we saw him when we passed."
Ron sat up straight, interested. It was not like Weasley to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.
"What did he do when he saw you?"
"The usual," said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand
gesture. "Not like him, though, is it? Well... that is" -- he did the hand gesture again -- "but why isn't he out there bullying first years?
"Dunno," said Ron, but his mind was racing. Didn't this look as though Weasley had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?
"Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad," said Ron. "Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that."
"I don't think so," said Ron. "I think he's ..."
But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.
"I'm supposed to deliver these to Ron Weasley and Ron P-Weasley," she faltered, as her eyes met Ron's and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Ron and Ron took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.
"What is it?" Ron demanded, as Ron unrolled his.
"An invitation," said Ron.
Ron,
I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.
Sincerely, Ron
"But what does he want me for?" asked Ron nervously, as though he was expecting detention.
"No idea," said Ron, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. "Listen," he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, "let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Weasley on the way, see what he's up to."
This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Ron stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Ron Weasley, who darted into her compartment when she saw Ron coming. As Ron passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Ron, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Ron pushed on.
When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Weasley's only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Weasley's welcome, Ron was the most warmly anticipated.
"Ron, m'boy!" said Weasley, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden
buttons on his waistcoat. "Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Weasley!"
Ron nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Weasley, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Ron glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Weasley from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Ron did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Weasley and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ron.
"Now, do you know everyone?" Weasley asked Ron and Ron. "Ron Weasley is in your year, of course --"
Weasley did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Ron or Ron: Weasley and Weasley students loathed each other on principle.
"This is Ron Weasley, perhaps you've come across each other ... ? No?"
Weasley, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Ron and Ron nodded back at him.
"... and this is Ron Belby, I don't know whether ...?"
Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.
"... and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!" Weasley finished.
Ron grimaced at Ron and Ron from behind Weasley's back.
"Well now, this is most pleasant," said Weasley cozily. "A chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I've packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on
licorice wands, and a poor old man's digestive system isn't quite up to such things... Pheasant, Belby?"
Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.
"I was just telling young Ron here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles," Weasley told Ron and Ron, now passing around
a basket of rolls. "Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Ron?"
Unfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Weasley he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.
"Anapneo," said Weasley calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.
"Not... not much of him, no," gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.
"Well, of course, I daresay he's busy," said Weasley, looking questioningly at Belby. "I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!"
"I suppose..." said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Weasley had finished with him. "Er... he and my dad don't get on very well, you see, so I don't really know much about..."
His voice tailed away as Weasley gave him a cold smile and turned to Weasley instead.
"Now, you, Ron," said Weasley, "I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?"
"Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was," said Weasley. "We went with Bertie Higgs and Ron Weasley; this was before he became Minister, obviously ..."
"Ah, you know Bertie and Ron too?" beamed Weasley, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. "Now tell me..."
It was as Ron had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential... everyone except Ron. Weasley, who was interrogated after Weasley, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Ron could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Ron's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Ron's parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Weasleyatrix Weasley and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Ron's interview, Ron had the impression that Weasley was reserving judgment on Ron, yet to see whether he had any of his parents' flair.
"And now," said Weasley, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. "Ron Weasley! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!" He contemplated Ron for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, "'The Ronsen One,' they're calling you now!"
Ron said nothing. Belby, Weasley, and Weasley were all staring at him.
"Of course," said Weasley, watching Ron closely, "there have been rumors for years... I remember when ... well ... after that terrible night ... Ron ... Ron ... and you survived ... and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary ..."
Weasley gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to
indicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Weasley.
"Yeah, Weasley, because you're so talented... at posing..."
"Oh dear!" chuckled Weasley comfortably, looking around at Ron, who was glaring at Weasley around Weasley's great belly. "You want to be careful, Ron! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!"
Weasley merely looked contemptuous.
"Anyway," said Weasley, turning back to Ron. "Such rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn't know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes ... but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!"
Ron, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Weasley beamed at him.
"So modest, so modest, no wonder Weasley is so fond ... you were there, then? But the rest of the stories ... so sensational, of course, one doesn't know quite what to believe ... this fabled prophecy, for instance ..."
"We never heard a prophecy," said Ron, turning geranium pink as he said it.
"That's right," said Ron staunchly. "Ron and I were both there too, and all this 'Ronsen One' rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual."
"You were both there too, were you?" said Weasley with great interest, looking from Ron to Ron, but both of them sat clam-like before his encouraging smile.
"Yes... well... it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of course..." Weasley said, sounding a little disappointed. "I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) ..."
He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Ron had the distinct impression that Weasley had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Ron and Ron.
The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Weasley had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the "Slug Club" at Hogwarts. Ron could not wait to leave, but couldn't see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Weasley looked around, blinking in the twilight.
"Good gracious, it's getting dark already! I didn't notice that they'd lit the lamps! You'd better go and change into your robes, all of you. Weasley, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Ron, Ron ... any time you're passing. Same goes for you, miss," he twinkled at Ron. "Well, off you go, off you go!"
As he pushed past Ron into the darkening corridor, Weasley shot him a filthy look that Ron returned with interest. He, Ron, and Ron followed Weasley back along the train.
"I'm glad that's over," muttered Ron. "Strange man, isn't he?" "Yeah, he is a bit," said Ron, his eyes on Weasley. "How come you ended up in there, Ron?"
"He saw me hex Ron Weasley," said Ron. "You remember that idiot from Weasley who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him ... when Weasley came in I thought I was going to got detention, but he just thought it was ;i really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?"
"Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother's famous," said Ron, scowling at the back of Weasley's head, "or because their uncle..."
But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful idea... In a minute's time, Weasley was going to reenter the Weasley sixth-year compartment and Weasley would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Weasleys... If Ron could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left ... Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows ... but nobody else seemed prepared to take Ron's suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them.
"I'll see you two later," said Ron under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself.
"But what're you ... ?" asked Ron.
"Later!" whispered Ron, darting after Weasley as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless.
The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Weasley without touching him, Ron was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Weasley opened the door. Weasley was already sliding it shut when Ron hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing.
"What's wrong with this thing?" said Weasley angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Ron's foot.
Ron seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Weasley, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Ron Weasley's lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Ron darted into the compartment, leapt onto Weasley's temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Weasley and Weasley were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Ron was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Weasley's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Weasley slammed the door shut and flung Weasley off him; Weasley collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Ron Weasley returned to his comic, and Weasley, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Ron Weasleys lap. Ron lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Ron stroke the sleek blond hair off Weasley's forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Ron could read every word of Weasley's comic directly
below him.
"So, Weasley," said Weasley, "what did Weasley want?"
"Just trying to make up to well-connected people," said Weasley,
who was still glowering at Weasley. "Not that he managed to find
many."
This information did not seem to please Weasley. "Who else had he invited?" he demanded.
"Weasley from Weasley," said Weasley.
"Oh yeah, his uncle's big in the Ministry," said Weasley.
"... someone else called Belby, from Weasley ..."
"Not him, he's a prat!" said Ron.
"... and Weasley, Weasley, and that Weasley girl," finished Weasley.
Weasley sat up very suddenly, knocking Ron's hand aside.
"He invited Weasley?."
"Well, I assume so, as Weasley was there," said Weasley indifferently.
"What's Weasley got to interest Weasley?"
Weasley shrugged.
"Weasley, precious Weasley, obviously he wanted a look at 'the Ronsen One,'" sneered Weasley, "but that Weasley girl! What's so special about her?"
"A lot of boys like her," said Ron, watching Weasley out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. "Even you think she's good-looking, don't you, Ron, and we all know how hard you are to please!
"I wouldn't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like," said Weasley coldly, and Ron looked pleased. Weasley sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.
"Well, I pity Weasley's taste. Maybe he's going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Weasley probably hasn't heard I'm on the train, or..."
"I wouldn't bank on an invitation," said Weasley. "He asked me about Weasleys father when I first arrived. They used to be old
friends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the Ministry he didn't look happy, and Weasley didn't get an invitation, did he? 1 don't think Weasley's interested in Death Eaters."
Weasley looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh.
"Well, who cares what he's interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher." Weasley yawned ostentatiously. "I
mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what's it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?"
"What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?" said Ron indignantly, ceasing grooming Weasley at once.
"Well, you never know," said Weasley with the ghost of a smirk. "I might have ... er ... moved on to bigger and better things."
Weasleyed in the luggage rack under his cloak, Ron's heart began to race. What would Ron and Ron say about this? Weasley and Weasley were gawping at Weasley; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Weasley had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Ron resumed the slow stroking of Weasley s hair, looking dumbfounded.
"Do you mean..."
Weasley shrugged.
"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it... When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S anyone's got? Of course he isn't. It'll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown."
"And you think you'll be able to do something for him?" asked
Weasley scathingly. "Sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet?"
"I've just said, haven't I? Maybe he doesn't care if I'm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for," said Weasley quietly.
Weasley and Weasley were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Ron was gazing down at Weasley as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring.
"I can see Hogwarts," said Weasley, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. "We'd better get our robes on."
Ron was so busy staring at Weasley, he did not notice Weasley reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Ron hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Weasley looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.
Ron was not afraid of Weasley, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Weasleys. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Weasley seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.
Ron could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Ron and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Weasley threw the door open and muscled his way out
into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Weasley and Weasley followed.
"You go on," Weasley told Ron, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. "I just want to check something."
Ron left. Now Ron and Weasley were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Weasley moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.
Ron peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Weasley wanted to hide from Ron? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend?
"Petrificus Totalus!"
Without warning, Weasley pointed his wand at Ron, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Weasley's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Weasley, who smiled broadly.
"I thought so," he said jubilantly. "I heard Weasley's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Weasley came back..."
His eyes lingered for a moment upon Ron's trainers.
"You didn't hear anything I care about, Weasley. But while I've got you here..."
And he stamped, hard, on Ron's face. Ron felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.
"That's from my father. Now, let's see..."
Weasley dragged the cloak out from under Ron's immobilized body and threw it over him.
"I don't reckon they'll find you till the trains back in London," he said quietly. "See you around, Weasley... or not."
And taking care to tread on Ron's fingers, Weasley left the compartment.
Chapter 8 -- Victorious Weasley
Ron could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone would, surely check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him.
Ron had never hated Weasley more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in... and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.
Ron and Ron would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Weasley table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.
He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Weasley, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words "Accio Wand!" over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.
He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Ron Weasley had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the
school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Weasley was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Ron to Weasley, Weasley, Weasley, and Ron Weasley.
The train lurched, causing Ron to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it...
Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, "Wotcher, Ron."
There was a flash of red light and Ron's body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Weasley, who was holding the Invisibiliiy Cloak she had just pulled away.
We'd better get out of here, quickly," she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. "Come on, we'll jump."
Ron hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.
The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Weasley was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak.
"Who did it?"
"Ron Weasley," said Ron bitterly. "Thanks for... well..."
"No problem," said Weasley, without smiling. From what Ron could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-lookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. "I can fix your nose if you stand still."
Ron did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Ron Weasley, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes,
"Episkey" said Weasley.
Ron’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt gingerly. It seemed to be mended.
"Thanks a lot!"
"You'd better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school," said Weasley, still unsmiling. As Ron swung the cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.
''Was that a Patronus?" asked Ron, who had seen Weasley send messages like this.
"Yes, I'm sending word to the castle that I've got you or they'll worry. Come on, we'd better not dawdle."
They set off toward the lane that led to the school.
"How did you find me?"
"I noticed you hadn't left the train and I knew you had that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I’d check."
"But what are you doing here, anyway?" Ron asked.
"I'm stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection," said Weasley.
"Is it just you who's stationed up here, or -- ?"
"No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Weasley are here too."
"Weasley, that Auror Weasley attacked last year?"
"That's right."
They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Ron looked sideways at Weasley under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Ron would have suggested he say something consoling about Ron to her, that it hadn't been her fault at all, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Ron's death; it was no more her fault than anyone else’s (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Ron if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Weasley's long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.
Having always traveled there by carriage, Ron had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Weasley behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.
"Alohomora!" he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.
"That won't work on these," said Weasley. "Weasley bewitched them himself."
Ron looked around, I could climb a wall," he suggested.
"No, you couldn't," said Weasley flatly. "Anti-intruder jinxes on all of them. Security's been tightened a hundredfold this summer."
"Well then," said Ron, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, "I suppose I'll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning."
"Someone's coming down for you," said Weasley, "Look."
A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Ron was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Weasley's wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Ron Weasley.
"Well, well, well," sneered Weasley, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open. "Nice of you to turn up, Weasley, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance."
"I couldn't change, I didn't have my --" Ron began, but Weasley cut across him.
"There is no need to wait, Ron, Weasley is quite -- ah
-- safe in my hands."
"I meant Weasley to get the message," said Weasley, frowning.
"Weasley was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Weasley here, so I took it instead. And incidentally," said Weasley, standing back to allow Ron to pass him, "I was interested to see your new Patronus."
He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back into place.
"I think you were better off with the old one," said Weasley, the malice in his voice unmistakable. "The new one looks weak."
As Weasley swung the lantern about, Ron saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Weasley's face. Then she was covered in darkness once more.
"Good night," Ron called to her over his shoulder, as he began the walk up to the school with Weasley. "Thanks for ... everything,"
"See you, Ron."
Weasley did not speak for a minute or so. Ron felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Weasley could not feel them burning him. He had loathed Weasley from their first encounter, but Weasley had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Ron's forgiveness by his attitude toward Ron. Whatever Weasley said, Ron had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Weasley's snide remarks to Ron about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Weasley had probably been a powerful factor in Ron rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Ron clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Weasley, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Ron was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.
"Fifty points from Weasley for lateness, I think," said Weasley. "And, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I don’t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We haven't even started pudding. You might have set a record, Weasley."
The fury and hatred bubbling inside Ron seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way
back to London than tell Weasley why he was late.
"I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?" Weasley continued. "And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect."
Still Ron remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode. He knew that Weasley had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Ron without anyone else listening.
They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hail. Ron wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Weasley table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Ron's mind, however, Weasley said, "No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I'm sure."
Ron turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Weasley. The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to Ron, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Weasley table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Ron, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.
"Where've you -- blimey, what've you done to your face?" said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity. I
"Why, what's wrong with it?" said Ron, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.
"You're covered in blood!" said Ron. "Come here --"
She raised her wand, said "Tergeo!" and siphoned off the dried blood.
"Thanks," said Ron, feeling his now clean face. "How's my nose looking?
"Normal," said Hermoine anxiously. "Why shouldn't it? Ron, what happened? We've been terrified!"
"I'll tell you later," said Ron curtly. He was very conscious that Ron, Ron, Ron, and Ron were listening in; even Nearly Headless Ron, the Weasley ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.
"But --" said Ron.
"Not now, Ron," said Ron, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Weasley would spread the story as wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldn't reach too many Weasley ears.
He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.
"You missed the Sorting, anyway," said Ron, as Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau.
"Hat say anything interesting?" asked Ron, taking a piece of treacle tart.
"More of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face enemies, you know."
"Weasley mentioned Weasley at all?"
"Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast doesn't he? It can't be long now."
"Weasley said Weasley was late for the feast --"
"You've seen Weasley? How come?" said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.
"Bumped into him," said Ron evasively.
"Weasley was only a few minutes late," said Ron. "Look, he's waving at you, Ron."
Ron looked up at the staff table and grinned at Weasley, who was indeed waving at him. Weasley had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor Weasley, Head of Weasley House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Weasley's elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Ron was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Weasley, sitting on Weasley's other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Ron had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Weasley to kill Ron's parents and attack Ron himself. The knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company, thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Weasley table. Ron Weasley was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and
applause. Ron dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would give to fight Weasley one-on-one...
"So what did Professor Weasley want?" Ron asked.
"To know what really happened at the Ministry." said Ron.
"Him and everyone else here," sniffed Ron. "People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren't they, Ron?"
"Yeah," said Ron. "All wanting to know if you really are 'the Ronsen One' --"
"There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts," interrupted Nearly Headless Ron, inclining his barely connected head toward Ron so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. "I am considered something of a Weasley authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. 'Ron Weasley knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,' I told them. 'I would rather die than betray his trust.'"
"That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead," Ron observed.
"Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe," said Nearly Headless Ron in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Weasley table just as Weasley got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.
"The very best of evenings to you!" he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room.
"What happened to his hand?" gasped Ron.
She was not the only one who had noticed. Weasley's right hand was as blackened and dead-looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Ron from the Weasleys. Whispers it the room; Weasley,
interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury.
"Nothing to worry about," he said airily. "Now ... to our new students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another year full of magical education awaits you ..."
"His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,"
Ron whispered to Ron. "I thought he'd have cured it by now, though ... or Ron Weasley would've done."
"It looks as if it's died," said Ron, with a nauseated expression. "But there are some injuries you can't cure... old curses...and there are poisons without antidotes. . . ."
"...and Mr. Weasley, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.
"Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
"We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year, Professor Weasley"-- Weasley stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow -- "is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master."
"Potions?"
"Potions?"
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered wheel they had heard right.
"Potions?" said Ron and Ron together, turning to stare Ron. "But you said --"
"Professor Weasley, meanwhile," said Weasley, raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering, "will be taking the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
"No!" said Ron, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Weasley be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn't it been widely known for years that Weasley did not trust him to do it?
"But Ron, you said that Weasley was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!" said Ron.
"I thought he was!" said Ron, racking his brains to remember when Weasley had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Weasley ever telling him what Weasley would be teaching.
Weasley, who was sitting on Weasley's right, did not stand up his mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Weasley table, yet Ron was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.
"Well, there's one good thing," he said savagely. "Weasley'll be gone by the end of the year."
"What do you mean?" asked Ron.
"That job's jinxed. No ones lasted more than a year... Weasley actually died doing it... Personally, I'm going to keep my fingers crossed for another death..."
"Ron!" said Ron, shocked and reproachful.
"He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year," said Ron reasonably. "That Weasley bloke might not want to stay long-term. Weasley didn't."
"Weasley cleared his throat. Ron, Ron, and Ron were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Weasley had finally achieved his heart’s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, Weasley said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.
"Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Weasley and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength."
The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Weasley spoke. Ron glanced at Weasley. Weasley was not looking at Weasley, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmaster's words unworthy of his attention.
"I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The castle’s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find them -- in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and others' safety."
Weasley's blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more.
"But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night. Pip pip!"
With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. Ron, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Weasley to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of Weasleys to draw ahead of him. Ron had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect's duty of shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Ron.
"What really happened to your nose?" he asked, once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else.
Ron told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh.
"I saw Weasley miming something to do with a nose," he said darkly.
"Yeah, well, never mind that," said Ron bitterly. "Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there..."
"Ron had expected Ron to be stunned by Weasleys boasts. With what Ron considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.
"Come on, Ron, he was just showing off for Weasley....
What kind of mission would You-Know-Who have given him?"
"How d'you know Weasley doesn't need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldn't be the first --"
"I wish yeh'd stop sayin' tha name, Ron," said a reproachful voice behind them. Ron looked over his shoulder to see Hagtid shaking his head.
"Weasley uses that name," said Ron stubbornly
"Yeah, well, tha's Weasley, innit?" said Weasley mysteriously.
"So how come yeh were late, Ron? I was worried."
"Got held up on the train," said Ron. "Why were you late?"
"I was with Ron," said Weasley happily. "Los' track o' the time. He's got a new home up in the mountains now, Weasley fixed it -- nice big cave. He's much happier than he was in the forest. We were havin' a good chat."
"Really?" said Ron, taking care not to catch Ron's eye; the last time he had met Weasley's half-brother, a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of which he was unable to pronounce properly.
"Oh yeah, he's really come on," said Weasley proudly. "Yeh'll be amazed. I'm thinkin' o' trainin' him up as me assistant."
Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze. They were now standing beside the oak front doors.
"Anyway, I'll see yeh tomorrow, firs' lesson's straight after lunch. Come early an' yeh can say hello ter Buck -- I mean, Witherwings!"
Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the doors into the darkness.
Ron and Ron looked at each other. Ron could tell that Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.
"You're not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?"
Ron shook his head. "And you're not either, are you?"
Ron shook his head too.
"And Ron," said Ron, "she's not, is she?"
Ron shook his head again. Exactly what Weasley would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject, he did not like to think.
Chapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince
Ron and Ron met Ron in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support in his theory, Ron lost no time in telling Ron what he had overheard Weasley saying on the Hogwarts Express.
"But he was obviously showing off for Weasley, wasn't he?" interjected Ron quickly, before Ron could say anything.
"Well," she said uncertainly, "I don't know. It would be like Weasley to make himself seem more important than he is ... but that's a big lie to tell..."
"Exactly," said Ron, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands.
"It's rude to point," Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Ron behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. "I love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax."
"We're going to need that time for studying, Ron!" said Ron, as they set off down the corridor.
"Yeah, but not today," said Ron. "Today's going to be a real loss, I reckon."
"Hold it!" said Ron, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. "Roned Frisbees banned, hand it over," she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Ron's grip.
"Excellent, I've always wanted one of these."
Ron's remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Ron Weasley had apparently found Ron's remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.
The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Ron and Ron told Ron about their embarassing conversation with Weasley the previous evening.
"But he can't really think we'd continue Care of Magical Creatures!" she said, looking distressed. "I mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?"
"That's it, though, innit?" said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. "We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like
Weasley. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. D'ya reckon anyone's going to go on to N.E.W.T.?"
Neither Ron nor Ron answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Weasley's eye and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.
After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor Weasley's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor Weasley needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.
Ron was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Ron took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor Weasley looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L results.
"Herbology, fine," she said. "Professor Weasley will be delighted to see you back with an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with 'Exceeds Expectations.' But the problem is Transfiguration. I'm sorry, Weasley, but an 'Acceptable' really isn't good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. Just don't think you'd be able to cope with the coursework."
Ron hung his head. Professor Weasley peered at him through her square spectacles.
"Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I've never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it."
Ron looked miserable and muttered something about "my grandmother wants."
"Hmph," snorted Professot Weasley. "It's high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she's got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry."
Ron turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor Weasley had never paid him a compliment before.
"I'm sorry, Weasley, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an 'Exceeds Expectations' in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?"
"My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option," mumbled Ron.
"Take Charms," said Professor Weasley, "and I shall drop Ron a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless." Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Ron's face, Professor Weasley tapped a blank
schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Ron.
Professor Weasley turned next to Ron Weasley, whose first question was whether Ron, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination.
"He and Professor Weasley are dividing classes between them this year," said Professor Weasley, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. "The sixth year is being taken by Professor Weasley."
Ron set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.
"So, Weasley, Weasley . . ." said Professor Weasley, consulting her notes as she turned to Ron. "Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Weasley, very pleased. Now, why haven't you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?"
"It was, but you told me I had to get an 'Outstanding' in my O.W.L., Professor."
"And so you did when Professor Weasley was teaching the subject. Professor Weasley, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations' at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?"
"Yes," said Ron, "but I didn't buy the books or any ingredients or anything-"
"I'm sure Professor Weasley will be able to lend you some," said Professor Weasley. "Very well, Weasley, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Weasley Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure."
A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Ron, and the two of them left the table together.
"Look," said Ron delightedly, gazing ar his schedule, "we've got a free period now. . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent."
They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Ron Weasley, the only remaining member of the original Weasley Quidditch team that Ron had joined in his first year.
"I thought you'd get that, well done," she called over, pointing at the Captains badge on Ron's chest. "Tell me when you call trials!"
"Don't be stupid," said Ron, "you don't need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . ."
"You mustn't start off like that," she said warningly. "For all you know, there's someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends...."
Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Roned Frisbee Ron had taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Ron's yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.
An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Ron was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon.
"We got so much homework for Runes," she said anxiously when Ron and Ron joined her. "A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!"
"Shame," yawned Ron.
"You wait," she said resentfully. "I bet Weasley gives us loads."
The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Weasley stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.
"Inside," he said.
Ron looked around as they entered. Weasley had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.
"I have not asked you to take out your books," said Weasley, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Ron hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. "I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention."
His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Ron's than anyone else's.
"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe."
You believe . . . like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Ron scathingly.
"Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced."
Weasley set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. "The Dark Arts," said Weasley, "are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible."
Ron stared at Weasley. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Weasley was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?
"Your defenses," said Weasley, a little louder, "must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures" - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - "give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse" - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - "feel the Dementor's Kiss" - a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall - "or provoke the aggression of the Inferius" - a bloody mass upon ground.
"Has an Inferius been seen, then?" said Ron Weasley in a high pitched voice. "Is it definite, is he using them?"
"The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past," said Weasley, "which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . "
He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. ,
". . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?"
Ron's hand shot into the air. Weasley took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, "Very well - Miss Weasley?"
"Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform," said Ron, "which gives you a split-second advantage."
"An answer copied almost word for word from The Rondard Book of Spells, Grade Six," said Weasley dismissively (over in the corner, Weasley sniggered), "but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some" - his gaze lingered maliciously upon Ron once more - "lack."
Ron knew Weasley was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Weasley until Weasley looked away.
"You will now divide," Weasley went on, "into pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on."
Although Weasley did not know it, Ron had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Ron managed to repel Ron's muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Weasley from any reasonable teacher, thought Ron bitterly, but which Weasley ignored. He swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Ron and Ron struggling with the task.
Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Ron, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Ron had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.
"Pathetic, Weasley," said Weasley, after a while. "Here -- let me show you-"
He turned his wand on Ron so fast that Ron reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, "Protego!"
His Shield Charm was so strong Weasley was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Weasley righted himself, scowling.
"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Weasley?"
"Yes," said Ron stiffly.
"Yes, sir."
"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor." The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Ron. Behind Weasley, however, Ron, Ron, and Ron grinned appreciatively.
"Detention, Saturday night, my office," said Weasley. "I do not take cheek from anyone, Weasley . . . not even 'the Ronsen One.'"
"That was brilliant, Ron!" chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later.
"You really shouldn't have said it," said Ron, frowning at Ron. "What made you?"
"He tried to jinx me, in case you didn't notice!" fumed Ron. I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn't he use
another guinea pig for a change? What's Weasley playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructble stuff –"
"Well," said Ron, "I thought he sounded a bit like you."
"Like me?"
"Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Weasley. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn't that what Weasley was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?"
Ron was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Rondard Book of Spells that he did not argue.
"Ron! Hey, Ron!"
Ron looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year's Weasley Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.
"For you," panted Sloper. "Listen, I heard you're the new Captain. When're you holding trials?"
"I'm not sure yet," said Ron, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. "I'll let you know."
"Oh, right. I was hoping it'd be this weekend -"
"But Ron was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Ron, unrolling the parchment as he went.
Dear Ron,
I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.
Yours sincerely,
Ron Weasley
P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.
"He enjoys Acid Pops?" said Ron, who had read the message over Ron's shoulder and was looking perplexed.
"It's the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study," said Ron in a low voice. "Ha! Weasley's not going to be pleased. . . . I won't be able to do his detention!"
He, Ron, and Ron spent the whole of break speculating on what Weasley would teach Ron. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Ron said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Weasley wanted to teach Ron advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Ron and Ron returned to the common
room where they grudgingly started Weasley's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Ron joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon's double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Weasley's.
When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Weasley and Weasley had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Weasleys had made it through, including Weasley. Four Weasleys were there, and one Weasley, Ron Weasley, whom Ron liked despite his rather pompous manner.
"Ron," Ron said portentously, holding out his hand as Ron approached, "didn't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron -- Ron?"
Before they could say more than "fine," the dungeon door opened and Weasley's belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Ron and Weasley with particular enthusiasm.
The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Ron, Ron, and Ron sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Weasleys took a table together, as did the four
Weasleys. This left Ron, Ron, and Ron to share a table with Ron. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Ron had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion's fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily.
"Now then, now then, now then," said Weasley, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. "Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies
of Advanced Potion-Making. . . ."
"Sir?" said Ron, raising his hand.
"Ron, m'boy?"
"I haven't got a book or scales or anything - nor's Ron - we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -"
"Ah, yes, Professor Weasley did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I'm sure we can lend you some scales, and we've got a small stock of old books here, they'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . ."
Weasley strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment's foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Ron and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.
"Now then," said Weasley, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, "I've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of 'em, even if you haven't made 'em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?"
He indicated the cauldron nearest the Weasley table. Ron raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.
Ron's well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else's; Weasley pointed at her.
"It's Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth," said Ron.
"Very good, very good!" said Weasley happily. "Now," he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Weasley table, "this one here is pretty well known... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too... Who can - ?"
Ron's hand was fastest once more.
"lt's Polyjuice Potion, sir," she said.
Ron too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Ron getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. "Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?" said Weasley, now looking slightly bemused, as Ron's hand punched the air again.
"It's Amortentia!"
"It is indeed. Ir seems almost foolish to ask," said Weasley, who was looking mightily impressed, "but I assume you know what it does?"
"It's the most powerful love porion in the world!" said Ron.
"Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?"
"And the steam rising in characteristic spirals," said Ron enthusiastically, "and it's supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and -"
But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.
'May I ask your name, my dear?" said Weasley, ignoring Ron's embarrassment.
"Ron Weasley, sir."
"Weasley? Weasley? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Weasley, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?"
"No. I don't think so, sir. I'm Muggle-born, you see."
Ron saw Weasley lean close to Weasley and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Weasley showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Ron to Ron, who was sitting next to her.
"Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!' I'm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Ron?"
"Yes, sir," said Ron.
"Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Weasley, Miss Weasley," said Weasley genially.
Weasley looked rather as he had done the time Ron had punched him in the face. Ron turned to Ron with a radiant expression and whispered, "Did you really tell him I'm the best in the year? Oh, Ron!"
"Well, what's so impressive about that?" whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. "You are the best in the year - I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!"
Ron smiled but made a "shhing" gesture, so that they could hear what Weasley was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
"Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes," he said, nodding gravely at Weasley and Weasley, both of whom were smirking skeptically. "When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love."
"And now," said Weasley, "it is time for us to start work."
"Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one," said Ron Weasley, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Weasley's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.
"Oho," said Weasley again. Ron was sure that Weasley had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. "Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it," he turned, smiling, to look at
Ron, who had let out an audible gasp, "that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Weasley?"
"It's liquid luck," said Ron excitedly. "It makes you lucky!"
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Ron could see of Weasley was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Weasley his full and undivided attention.
"Quite right, take another ten points for Weasley. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis," said Weasley. "Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off."
"Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?" said Ron Weasley eagerly.
"Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence," said Weasley. "Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . ."
"Have you ever taken it, sir?" asked Ron Weasley with great interest.
"Twice in my life," said Weasley. "Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days."
He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting or not, thought Ron, the effect was good.
"And that," said Weasley, apparently coming back to earth, "is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson."
There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.
"One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis," said Weasley, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. "Enough for twelve hours' luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt."
"Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!"
"So," said Weasley, suddenly brisk, "how are you to win this fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!"
There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Ron saw Weasley riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making., It could not have been clearer that Weasley really wanted that lucky day. Ron bent swiftly over the tattered book Weasley had lent him.
To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Ron hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Weasley cutting up Valerian roots as fast as he could.
Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Ron, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the "smooth, black currant-colored liquid" mentioned as the ideal halfway stage.
Having finished chopping his roots, Ron bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction:
Crush with flat side of silver dagger,
releases juice better than cutting.
"Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Weasley?" Ron looked up; Weasley was just passing the Weasley table.
"Yes," said Weasley, without looking at Weasley, "I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn't unexpected, dragon pox at his age..."
And he walked away. Ron bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Weasley had expected to be treated like Ron or Weasley; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Weasley. It looked as though Weasley would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis.
The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Ron turned to Ron.
"Can I borrow your silver knife?"
She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.
Ron crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all.
Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.
His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Ron now squinted at the next line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?
Ron stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned pale pink.
"How are you doing that?" demanded Ron, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.
"Add a clockwise stir -"
"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!" she snapped.
Ron shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . .
Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Ron glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.
"And time's . . . up!" called Weasley. "Stop stirring, please!"
Weasley moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Ron, Ron, Ron, and Ron were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron's cauldron. He passed over Ron's navy concoction. Ron's potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Ron's, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
"The clear winner!" he cried to the dungeon. "Excellent, excellent, Ron! Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Ron was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!"
Ron slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Weasleys' faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Ron's. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.
"How did you do that?" he whispered to Ron as they left the dungeon.
"Got lucky, I suppose," said Ron, because Weasley was within earshot.
Once they were securely ensconced at the Weasley table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Ron's face became stonier with every word he uttered.
"I s'pose you think I cheated?" he finished, aggravated by her expression.
"Well, it wasn't exactly your own work, was it?" she said stiffly.
"He only followed different instructions to ours," said Ron, "Could've been a catastrophe, couldn't it? But he took a risk and it paid off." He heaved a sigh. "Weasley could've handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one's ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but-"
"Hang on," said a voice close by Ron's left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Weasley's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ron had joined them. "Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Ron?"
She looked alarmed and angry. Ron knew what was on her mind at once.
"It's nothing," he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. "It's not like, you know, Weasley's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on."
"But you're doing what it says?"
"I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ron, there's nothing funny -"
"Ron's got a point," said Ron, perking up at once. "We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?"
"Hey!" said Ron indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand. "Specialis Revelio!" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared.
"Finished?" said Ron irritably. "Or d'you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?"
"It seems all right," said Ron, still staring at the book suspiciously. "I mean, it really does seem to be ... just a textbook."
"Good. Then I'll have it back," said Ron, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. Nobody else was looking. Ron bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small,
cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.
This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince.
Chapter 10: The Hour of Weasley
For or the rest of the week's Potions lessons Ron continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Weasley was raving about Rons abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Ron was delighted by this. Although Ron had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Ron did, and could not keep asking Ron to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Ron, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the "official" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's.
Ron wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.
"Or herself," said Ron irritably, overhearing Ron pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. "It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl's than a boy's."
"The Half-Blood Prince, he was called," Ron said. "How many girls have been Princes?"
Ron seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down.
Ron looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag.
"It's five to eight, I'd better go, I'll be late for Weasley."
"Ooooh!" gasped Ron, looking up at once. "Good luck! We'll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!"
"Hope it goes okay," said Ron, and the pair of them watched Ron leave through the portrait hole.
Ron proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Weasley appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked.
"Two of spades: conflict," she murmured, as she passed the place where Ron crouched, hidden. "Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner --"
She stopped dead, right on the other side of Ron's statue.
"Well, that can't be right," she said, annoyed, and Ron heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Ron waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.
"Acid Pops," said Ron, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Ron stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Weasley's Office.
Ron knocked.
"Come in," said Weasley s voice.
"Good evening, sir," said Ron, walking into the headmaster's office.
"Ah, good evening, Ron. Sit down," said Weasley, smiling. "I hope you've had an enjoyable first week back at school?" "Yes, thanks, sir," said Ron.
"You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!" "Er," began Ron awkwardly, but Weasley did not look too stern.
"I have arranged with Professor Weasley that you will do your detention next Saturday instead."
"Right," said Ron, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Weasleys detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Weasley was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Weasley's magnificent phoenix, Ron, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Ron with bright interest. It did not even look as though Weasley had cleared a space for dueling practice.
"So, Ron," said Weasley, in a businesslike voice. "You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these -- for want of a better word -- lessons?"
"Yes, sir."
"Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Weasley to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information." There was a pause.
"You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything," said Ron. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. "Sir," he added.
"And so I did," said Weasley placidly. "I told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and
journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Ron, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron."
"But you think you're right?" said Ron.
"Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being -- forgive me -- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger."
"Sir," said Ron tentatively, "does what you're going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?"
"It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy," said Weasley, as casually as if Ron had asked him about the next days weather, "and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive."
Weasley got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Ron, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Weasley bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Weasley straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Ron.
"You look worried."
Ron had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts
and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Weasley was smiling.
"This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission."
"Where are we going, sir?"
"For a trip down Ron Weasley's memory lane," said Weasley, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery-white substance.
"Who was Ron Weasley?"
"He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement," said Weasley. "He died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Ron ..."
But Weasley was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful.
"Shall --shall I, sir?"
"No matter, Ron --"
Weasley pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out.
"Sir -- how did you injure your hand?" Ron asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity.
"Now is not the moment for that story, Ron. Not yet. We have an appointment with Ron Weasley."
Weasley tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. "After you," said Weasley, gesturing toward the bowl. Ron bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-denly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Weasley landed beside him.
They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Ron knew this must be Weasley; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before
Ron had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Weasley had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.
Weasley and Ron followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Ron looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Weasley said Little Hangleton, 1 mile.
They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Ron could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.
Weasley had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Weasley lengthened his stride, and Ron hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Weasley, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Weasley's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.
Weasley and Ron followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Weasley and Ron came to a halt behind Weasley, who had stopped and drawn his wand.
Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Ron's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking.
Weasley moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Ron, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake.
Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Weasley, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled.
"You're not welcome."
The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Ron could not blame Weasley for backing away several more paces before he spoke.
"Er -- good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic --" "You're not welcome."
"Er -- I'm sorry -- I don't understand you," said Weasley nervously.
Ron thought Weasley was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Ron's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.
"You understand him, I'm sure, Ron?" said Weasley quietly. "Yes, of course," said Ron, slightly nonplussed. "Why can't Weasley -- ?"
But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood.
"He's speaking Parseltongue?"
"Very good," said Weasley, nodding and smiling.
The man in rags was now advancing on Weasley, knife in one hand, wand in the other.
"Now, look --" Weasley began, but too late: There was a bang, and Weasley was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.
"Ron!" said a loud voice.
An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Weasley on the ground.
"Ministry, is it?" said the older man, looking down at Weasley. "Correct!" said Weasley angrily, dabbing his face. "And you, I take it, are Mr. Weasley?"
"S'right," said Weasley. "Got you in the face, did he?" "Yes, he did!" snapped Weasley.
"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?" said Weasley aggressively. "This is private property. Can't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself."
"Defend himself against what, man?" said Weasley, clambering back to his feet.
"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth." Weasley pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Weasley spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Ron. "Get in the house. Don't argue."
This time, ready for it, Ron recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Weasley could hear. Ron seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again.
"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Weasley," said Weasley, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. "That was Ron, wasn't it?"
"Ah, that was Ron," said the old man indifferently. "Are you pure-blood?" he asked, suddenly aggressive.
"That's neither here nor there," said Weasley coldly, and Ron felt his respect for Weasley rise. Apparently Weasley felt rather differently.
He squinted into Weasley’s face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, "Now I come to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village."
"I don't doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them," said Weasley. "Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?"
"Inside?"
"Yes, Mr. Weasley. I've already told you. I'm here about Ron. We sent an owl --"
"I've no use for owls," said Weasley. "I don't open letters."
"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors," said Weasley tartly. "I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning --"
"All right, all right, all right!" bellowed Weasley. "Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it'll do you!"
The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room com-bined. Ron was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue:
Hissy, hissy, little snakey,
Slither on the floor
You be good to Ron
Or he'll nail you to the door.
There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Ron realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Ron thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person.
"M'daughter, Ron," said Weasley grudgingly, as Weasley looked inquiringly toward her.
"Good morning," said Weasley.
She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her.
"Well, Mr. Weasley," said Weasley, "to get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Ron, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night."
There was a deafening clang. Ron had dropped one of the pots.
"Pick it up!" Weasley bellowed at her. "That's it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what's your wand for, you useless sack of muck?"
"Mr. Weasley, please!" said Weasley in a shocked voice, as Ron, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.
Ron let out a mad cackle of laughter. Weasley screamed, "Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!"
Ron stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Weasley had lifted his own and said firmly, "Reparo. " The pot mended itself instantly.
Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Weasley, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, "Lucky the nice man from the Ministry's here, isn't it? Perhaps he'll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs. . . ."
Without looking at anybody or thanking Weasley, Ron picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish.
"Mr. Weasley," Weasley began again, "as I've said: the reason for my visit --"
"I heard you the first time!" snapped Weasley. "And so what? Ron gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him -- what about it, then?"
"Ron has broken Wizarding law," said Weasley sternly.
"'Ron has broken Wizarding law.'" Weasley imitated Weasley’s voice, making it pompous and singsong. Ron cackled again. "He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that's illegal now, is it?"
"Yes," said Weasley. "I'm afraid it is."
He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it.
"What's that, then, his sentence?" said Weasley, his voice rising angrily.
"It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing --"
"Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?"
"I'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad," said Weasley.
"And you think we're scum, do you?" screamed Weasley, advancing on Weasley now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. "Scum who'll come running when the Ministry tells 'em to? Do you know who you're talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?"
"I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Weasley," said Weasley, looking wary, but standing his ground.
"That's right!" roared Weasley. For a moment, Ron thought Weasley was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Weasley the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Weasley's eyes. "See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it's been in our family, that's how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been offered for this, with the Weasley coat of arms engraved on the stone?"
"I've really no idea," said Weasley, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, "and it's quite beside the point, Mr. Weasley. Your son has committed --"
With a howl of rage, Weasley ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Ron thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Weasley by a gold chain around her neck.
"See this?" he bellowed at Weasley, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Ron spluttered and gasped for breath.
"I see it, I see it!" said Weasley hastily.
"Weasleys!" yelled Weasley. "Ron Weasley's! We're his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?"
"Mr. Weasley, your daughter!" said Weasley in alarm, but Weasley had already released Ron; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air.
"So!" said Weasley triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. "Don't you go talking to us as if we're dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all -- more than you can say, I don't doubt!"
And he spat on the floor at Weasleys feet. Ron cackled again. Ron, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing.
"Mr. Weasley," said Weasley doggedly, "I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Ron, Ron and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information" -- he glanced down at his scroll of parchment -- "is that Ron performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives."
Ron giggled.
"Be quiet, boy," snarled Weasley in Parseltongue, and Ron fell silent again.
"And so what if he did, then?" Weasley said defiantly to Weasley, "I expect you've wiped the Muggle's filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot--"
"That's hardly the point, is it, Mr. Weasley?" said Weasley. "This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless --"
"Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you," sneered Weasley, and he spat on the floor again.
"This discussion is getting us nowhere," said Weasley firmly. "It is clear from your son's attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions." He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. "Ron will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg --"
Weasley broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Weasley froze, listening, his eyes wide. Ron hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Ron raised her head. Her face, Ron saw, was starkly white.
"My God, what an eyesore!" rang out a girl's voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. "Couldn't your father have that hovel cleared away, Ron?"
"It's not ours," said a young man's voice. "Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Weasley, and his children. The son's quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village --"
The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Ron made to get out of his armchair. "Keep your seat," said his father warningly, in Parseltongue.
"Ron," said the girl's voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, "I might be wrong -- but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?"
"Good lord, you're right!" said the man's voice. "That'll be the son, I told you he's not right in the head. Don't look at it, Cecilia, darling."
The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again.
"'Darling,'" whispered Ron in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. "'Darling, he called her. So he wouldn't have you anyway."
Ron was so white Ron felt sure she was going to faint.
"What's that?" said Weasley sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. "What did you say, Ron?"
"She likes looking at that Muggle," said Ron, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. "Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isn't she? And last night -- "
Ron shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Ron went on ruthlessly, "Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn't she?"
"Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?" said Weasley quietly.
All three of the Weasleys seemed to have forgotten Weasley, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping.
"Is it true?" said Weasley in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. "My daughter--pure-blooded descendant of Ron Weasley -- hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?"
Ron shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak.
"But I got him, Ronher!" cackled Ron. "I got him as he went by and he didn't look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Ron?"
"You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!" roared Weasley, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter's throat.
Both Ron and Weasley yelled "No!" at the same time; Weasley raised his wand and cried, "Relaskio!"
Weasley was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Ron leapt out of his chair and ran at Weasley, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand.
Weasley ran for his life. Weasley indicated that they ought to follow and Ron obeyed, Ron's screams echoing in his ears.
Weasley hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Weasley, who bounced off the horse's flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane.
"I think that will do, Ron," said Weasley. He took Ron by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Weasley's now twilit office.
"What happened to the girl in the cottage?" said Ron at once, as Weasley lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. "Ron, or whatever her name was?"
"Oh, she survived," said Weasley, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Ron should sit down too. "Weasley Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Ron and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Ron, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Ron, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Weasley, received six months."
"Ron?" Ron repeated wonderingly.
"That's right," said Weasley, smiling in approval. "I am glad to see you're keeping up."
"That old man was -- ?"
"Weasley's grandfather, yes," said Weasley. "Ron, his son, Ron, and his daughter, Ron, were the last of the Weasleys, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Ron was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter."
"So Ron," said Ron, leaning forward in his chair and star-ing at Weasley, "so Ron was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Weasley's mother?"
"It does," said Weasley. "And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Weasley's father. I wonder whether you noticed?"
"The Muggle Ron attacked? The man on the horse?"
"Very good indeed," said Weasley, beaming. "Yes, that was Ron Weasley senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Weasley cottage and for whom Ron Weasley cherished a secret, burning passion."
"And they ended up married?" Ron said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.
"I think you are forgetting," said Weasley, "that Ron was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Ron and Ron were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years."
"Can you not think of any measure Ron could have taken to make Ron Weasley forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?"
"The Imperius Curse?" Ron suggested. "Or a love potion?"
"Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Weasley was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Ron."
"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Ron's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done."
"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death -- or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Ron, and he did not live to see Ron return to the cottage."
"And Ron? She ... she died, didn't she? Wasn't Weasley brought up in an orphanage?"
"Yes, indeed," said Weasley. "We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Ron
Weasley reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being 'hoodwinked' and 'taken in.' What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Ron had lied to Ron Weasley, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason."
"But she did have his baby."
"But not until a year after they were married. Ron Weasley left her while she was still pregnant."
"What went wrong?" asked Ron. "Why did the love potion stop working?"
"Again, this is guesswork," said Weasley, "but I believe that Ron, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son."
The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Weasley's office seemed to glow more brightly than before.
"I think that will do for tonight, Ron," said Weasley after a moment or two.
"Yes, sir," said Ron.
He got to his feet, but did not leave.
"Sir ... is it important to know all this about Weasley's past?"
"Very important, I think," said Weasley.
"And it... it's got something to do with the prophecy?"
"It has everything to do with the prophecy."
"Right," said Ron, a little confused, but reassured all the same.
He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. "Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Ron everything you've told me?"
Weasley considered him for a moment, then said, "Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Weasley have proved themselves trust-worthy. But Ron, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else.
It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Weasley's secrets."
"No, sir, I'll make sure it's just Ron and Ron. Good night."
He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone.
"Sir," said Ron, staring at it. "That ring--"
"Yes?" said Weasley.
"You were wearing it when we visited Professor Weasley that night."
"So I was," Weasley agreed.
"But isn't it... sir, isn't it the same ring Ron Weasley showed Weasley?"
Weasley bowed his head. "The very same."
"But how come -- ? Have you always had it?"
"No, I acquired it very recently," said Weasley. "A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle's, in fact."
"That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?"
"Around that time, yes, Ron."
Ron hesitated. Weasley was smiling.
"Sir, how exactly -- ?"
"Too late, Ron! You shall hear the story another time. Good night."
"Good night, sir."
Chapter 11: Ron's helping hand
As Ron had predicted, the sixth years' free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Ron barely understood half of what Professor Weasley said to them these days; even Ron had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Ron's increasing resentment, Ron's best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Ron frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.
One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Ron, Ron, and Ron had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Weasley. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed
him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings.
"We've got to go and explain," said Ron, looking up at Weasley's huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast.
"We've got Quidditch tryouts this morning!" said Ron. "And we're supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Weasley! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?"
"We didn't hate it!" said Ron.
"Speak for yourself, I haven't forgotten the skrewts," said Ron darkly. "And I'm telling you now, we've had a narrow escape. You didn't hear him going on about his gormless brother -- we'd have been teaching Ron how to tie his shoelaces if we'd stayed."
"I hate not talking to Weasley," said Ron, looking upset.
"We'll go down after Quidditch," Ron assured her. He too was missing Weasley, although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Ron in their lives. "But trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied." He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. "I dunno why the team's this popular all of a sudden."
"Oh, come on, Ron," said Ron, suddenly impatient. "It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable."
Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Ron spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Ron.
"Everyone knows you've been telling the truth now, don't they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Weasley being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they're calling you 'the Ronsen One' -- well, come on, can't you see why people are fascinated by you?"
Ron was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.
"And you've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. ..."
"You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look," said Ron, shaking back his sleeves.
"And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either," Ron finished, ignoring Ron.
"I'm tall," said Ron inconsequentially.
The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Ron had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Weasley might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Ron circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Ron.
"Ha!" said Ron, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts.
"Oh good," said Ron, delighted. "Now you can give that graffitied copy back."
"Are you mad?" said Ron. "I'm keeping it! Look, I've thought it out --"
He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, "Dijjindo!" The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book (Ron looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, "Reparo!"
There sat the Prince's copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand.
"I'll give Weasley back the new one, he can't complain, it cost nine Galleons."
Ron pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that day's copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page.
"Anyone we know dead?" asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time Ron opened her paper.
"No, but there have been more dementor attacks," said Ron. "And an arrest."
"Excellent, who?" said Ron, thinking of Weasleyatrix Weasley. "Ron Weasley," said Ron.
"What?" said Ron, startled.
"'Ronley Weasley, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Weasley, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home. . .'"
"Ron Weasley, a Death Eater?" said Ron, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. "No way!"
"He might have been put under the Imperius Curse," said Ron reasonably. "You never can tell."
"It doesn't look like it," said Ron, who was still reading. "It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters' secret plans in a pub." She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. "If he was under the Imperius Curse, he'd hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?"
"It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did," said Ron. "Isn't he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?"
"Yeah, that's him," said Ron. "I dunno what they're playing at, taking Ron seriously."
"They probably want to look as though they're doing something," said Ron, frowning. "People are terrified -- you know the Weasley twins' parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night."
"What!" said Ron, goggling at Ron. "But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! We've got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we've got Weasley!"
"I don't think we've got him all the time," said Ron very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet. "Haven't you noticed? His seat's been empty as often as Weasley's this past week."
Ron and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster's chair was indeed empty. Now Ron came to think of it, he had not seen Weasley since their private lesson a week ago.
"I think he's left the school to do something with the Order," said Ron in a low voice. "I mean . . . it's all looking serious, isn't it?"
Ron and Ron did not answer, but Ron knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Ron Weasley had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Ron since.
When they left the Weasley table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Ron Weasley and Ron Weasley. Remembering what Ron had said about the Weasley twins' parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Ron was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Ron suddenly nudged Ron, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Ron resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Weasley had broken
Ron's nose; Ron, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.
As Ron had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Weasley House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Ron recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.
"We met on the train, in old Sluggy's compartment," he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Ron's hand. "Ron Weasley, Keeper."
"You didn't try out last year, did you?" asked Ron, taking note of the breadth of Weasley and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.
"I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials," said Weasley, with something of a swagger. "Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet."
"Right," said Ron. "Well. . . if you wait over there ..." He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Ron was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over Weasley's face and wondered whether Weasley expected preferential treatment because they were both "old Sluggy's" favorites. Ron decided to start with a basic test, asking all
applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts.
The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Ron had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Ron Weasley was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else.
The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Weasleys.
"If there's anyone else here who's not from Weasley," roared Ron, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, "leave now, please!
There was a pause, then a couple of little Weasleys went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.
After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Ron had found himself three Chasers: Ron Weasley, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Ron Weasley, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ron Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices,
Ron had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.
"That's my final decision and if you don't get out of the way of the Keepers I'll hex you," he bellowed.
Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Ron and Ron, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Ronmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Ron's head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Ron, Ron, and Ron in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.
Ron had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Ron glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Ron had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.
None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Ron's great disappointment, Ron Weasley saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong
direction; the crowd laughed and booed and Weasley returned to the ground grinding his teeth.
Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. "Good luck!" cried a voice from the stands. Ron looked around, expecting to see Ron, but it was Ron Weasley. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.
Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Ron turned to Weasley to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find Weasley's red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily.
"His sister didn't really try," said Weasley menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Ron had often ad-mired in Uncle Ron's. "She gave him an easy save."
"Rubbish," said Ron coldly. "That was the one he nearly missed."
Weasley took a step nearer Ron, who stood his ground this time.
"Give me another go."
"No," said Ron. "You've had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron's Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way."
He thought for a moment that Weasley might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air.
Ron turned around to find his new team beaming at him.
"Well done," he croaked. "You flew really well --"
"You did brilliantly, Ron!"
This time it really was Ron running toward them from the stands; Ron saw Ron walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Ron, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Ron.
After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Ron, Ron, and Ron bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Weasley's. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Ron felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be some-thing to eat at Weasley's.
"I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty," Ron was saying happily. "Tricky shot from Ron, did you see, had a bit of spin on it --"
"Yes, yes, you were magnificent," said Ron, looking amused.
"I was better than that Weasley anyway," said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. "Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like he'd been Confunded. ..."
To Ron's surprise, Ron turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail.
The great gray hippogriff, Ron, was tethered in front of Weasley's cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them.
"Oh dear," said Ron nervously. "He's still a bit scary, isn't he?"
"Come off it, you've ridden him, haven't you?" said Ron. Ron stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Ron sank into a bow too.
"How are you?" Ron asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head. "Missing him? But you're okay here with Weasley, aren't you?"
"Oi!" said a loud voice.
Weasley had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Ron, was at his heels; Ron gave a booming bark and bounded forward.
"Git away from him! He'll have yer fingers -- oh. It's yeh lot."
Ron was jumping up at Ron and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Weasley stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.
"Oh dear!" said Ron, looking stricken.
"Don't worry about it," said Ron grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly. "Weasley! Open up, we want to talk to you!"
There was no sound from within.
"If you don't open the door, we'll blast it open!" Ron said, pulling out his wand.
"Ron!" said Ron, sounding shocked. "You can't possibly --"
"Yeah, I can!" said Ron. "Rond back --"
But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Ron had known it would, and there stood Weasley, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.
"I'm a teacher!" he roared at Ron. "A teacher, Weasley! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!"
"I'm sorry, sir" said Ron, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes.
Weasley looked stunned. "Since when have yeh called me 'sir'?"
"Since when have you called me 'Weasley'?"
"Oh, very clever," growled Weasley. "Very amusin'. That's me outsmarted, innit? All righ', come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . ."
Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Ron scurried in after Ron, looking rather frightened.
"Well?" said Weasley grumpily, as Ron, Ron, and Ron sat down around his enormous wooden table, Ron laying his head immediately upon Ron's knee and drooling all over his robes. "What's this? Feelin' sorry for me? Reckon I'm lonely or summat?"
"No," said Ron at once. "We wanted to see you."
"We've missed you!" said Ron tremulously.
"Missed me, have yeh?" snorted Weasley. "Yeah. Righ'."
He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Ron was hungry enough even for Weasley's cooking, and took one at once.
"Weasley," said Ron timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, "we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know." Weasley gave another great snort. Ron rather thought some bo-geys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner.
"We did!" said Ron. "But none of us could fit it into our schedules!"
"Yeah. Righ'," said Weasley again.
There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Ron let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing.
"What are they, Weasley?" asked Ron, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.
"Jus' giant grubs," said Weasley.
"And they grow into ... ?" said Ron, looking apprehensive.
"They won' grow inter nuthin'," said Weasley. "I got 'em ter feed ter Ron."
And without warning, he burst into tears.
"Weasley!" cried Ron, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. "What is it?"
"It's. . . him . .." gulped Weasley, his beetle-black eyes stream-ing as he mopped his face with his apron. "It's . . . Ron. ... I think he's dyin'. . , . He got ill over the summer an' he's not gettin' better.... I don' know what I'll do if he ... if he ... We've bin tergether so long. ..."
Ron patted Weasley's shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Ron knew how she felt. He had known Weasley to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Ron, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
"Is there -- is there anything we can do?" Ron asked, ignoring Ron's frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
"I don' think there is, Ron," choked Weasley, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. "See, the rest o' the tribe ... Ron's family . . . they're gettin' a bit funny now he's ill... bit restive ..."
"Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them," said Ron in an undertone.
"... I don' reckon it'd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo'," Weasley finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. "But thanks fer offerin', Ron. ... It means a lot."
After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Ron nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Weasley seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.
"Ar, I always knew yeh'd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables," he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. "Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners --"
"We couldn't have done," said Ron. "We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet."
"Ar, well then," said Weasley. "There's no way yeh could've done it. ... I'm sorry I've bin -- yeh know -- I've jus' bin worried about Ron ... an I did wonder whether, if Professor Weasley had bin teachin' yeh --"
At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Weasley, who had substituted for Weasley a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Weasley waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful.
"I'm starving," said Ron, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. "And I've got that detention with Weasley tonight, I haven't got much time for dinner."
As they came into the castle they spotted Ron Weasley entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Ron caught Ron's arm and held her back.
"What?" said Ron defensively.
"If you ask me," said Ron quietly, "Weasley looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting."
Ron blushed.
"Oh, all right then, I did it," she whispered. "But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ron! Anyway, he's got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn't get in -- you wouldn't have wanted someone like that on the team."
"No," said Ron. "No, I suppose that's true. But wasn't that dishonest, Ron? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?"
"Oh, be quiet," she snapped, as he smirked.
"What are you two doing?" demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious.
"Nothing," said Ron and Ron together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Ron's stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Weasley table when Professor Weasley appeared in front of them, blocking their path.
"Ron, Ron, just the man I was hoping to see!" he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, "I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We're having a little party, just a few rising stars, I've got Weasley coming and Weasley, the charming Melinda Ronbin -- I don't know whether you know her? Her family owns a large
chain of apothecaries -- and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Weasley will favor me by coming too."
Weasley made Ron a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; Weasley did not so much as look at him.
"I can't come, Professor," said Ron at once. "I've got a detention with Professor Weasley."
"Oh dear!" said Weasley, his face falling comically. "Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Ron! Well, now, I'll just have to have a word with Ron and explain the situation. I'm sure I'll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I'll see you both later!" He bustled away out of the Hall.
"He's got no chance of persuading Weasley," said Ron, the moment Weasley was out of earshot. "This detention’s already been postponed once; Weasley did it for Weasley, but he won't do it for anyone else."
"Oh, I wish you could come, I don't want to go on my own!" said Ron anxiously; Ron knew that she was thinking about Weasley.
"I doubt you'll be alone, Ron'll probably be invited," snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Weasley.
After dinner they made their way back to Weasley Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but
they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Weasley, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Ron reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair.
"Anything new?" said Ron.
"Not really. . ." Ron had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. "Oh, look, your dad's in here, Ron -- he's all right!" she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. "It just says he's been to visit the Weasleys' house. 'This second search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Ron Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off.'"
"Yeah, mine!" said Ron. "I told him at Kings Cross about Weasley and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it's not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him --"
"But how can he have done, Ron?" said Ron, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. "We were all searched when we arrived, weren't we?"
"Were you?" said Ron, taken aback. "I wasn't!"
"Oh no, of course you weren't, I forgot you were late. Well, Weasley ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Weasley had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Weasley can't have brought in anything dangerous!"
Momentarily stymied, Ron watched Ron Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection.
"Someone's sent it to him by owl, then," he said. "His mother or someone."
"All the owls are being checked too," said Ron. "Weasley told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach."
Really stumped this time, Ron found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Weasley could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Ron Weasley.
"Can you think of any way Weasley -- ?"
"Oh, drop it, Ron," said Ron.
"Listen, it's not my fault Weasley invited Ron and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!" said Ron, firing up.
"Well, as I'm not invited to any parties," said Ron, getting to his feet again, "I think I'll go to bed."
He stomped off toward the door to the boys' dormitories, leaving Ron and Ron staring after him.
"Ron?" said the new Chaser, Ron Weasley, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. "I've got a message for you."
"From Professor Weasley?" asked Ron, sitting up hopefully.
"No ... from Professor Weasley," said Ron. Ron's heart sank. "He says you're to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention -- er -- no matter how many party invitations you've received. And he wanted you to know you'll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and -- and he says there's no need to bring protective gloves."
"Right," said Ron grimly. "Thanks a lot, Ron."
Chapter 12: Silver and opals
Where was Weasley, and what was he doing?
Ron caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Ron was sure Ron was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Weasley forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Ron? Weasley had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Ron had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.
Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Ron had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.
Ron woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Ron, who was simply weird that way. Ron felt, however, that the Half-Blood Princes copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Ron pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that was earning him such a glowing reputation with Weasley, but also the imaginative little
jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Ron was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.
Ron had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Weasley in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Ron Weasley); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with out being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Ron, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Ron had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Ron turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Ron snored loudly, Ron stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . . that had to mean "nonverbal." Ron rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Weasley had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class.
On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Weasley so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. "Aaaaaaaargh!"
There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Ron sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.
"Sorry!" yelled Ron, as Ron and Ron roared with laughter, and Ron picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of Bed. "Hang on -- I'll let you down --"
He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered the cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, Ron thought Liberacorpus! with all his might. There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress.
"Sorry," repeated Ron weakly, while Ron and Ron continued to roar with laughter.
"Ronorrow," said Ron in a muffled voice, "I'd rather you set the alarm clock."
By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasleys hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron's shock had subsided and he had decided that Ron's new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Ron with the story as they sat down for breakfast.
"... and then there was another flash, of light and I landed on the bed again!" Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages.
Ron had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Ron.
"Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?" she asked.
Ron frowned at her.
"Always jump to the worst conclusion, don't you?"
"Was it?"
"Well. . . yeah, it was, but so what?"
"So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?"
"Why does it matter if it's handwritten?" said Ron, preferring not to answer the rest of the question.
"Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic approved," said Ron. "And also," she added, as Ron and Ron rolled their eyes, "because I'm starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy."
Both Ron and Ron shouted her down at once.
"It was a laugh!" said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. "Just a laugh, Ron, that's all!"
"Dangling people upside down by the ankle?" said Hermi-one. "Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?"
"Ron and Ron," said Ron, shrugging, "it's their kind of thing. And, er--"
"My dad," said Ron. He had only just remembered.
"What?" said Ron and Ron together.
"My dad used this spell," said Ron. "I -- Weasley told me."
'This last part was not true; in fact, Ron had seen his father use the spell on Weasley, but he had never told Ron and Ron about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be -- ?
"Maybe your dad did use it, Ron," said Ron, "but he's not the only one. We've seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you've forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless."
Ron stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.
"That was different," he said robustly. "They were abusing it. Ron and his dad were just having a laugh. You don't like the Prince, Ron," he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, "because he's better than you at Potions --"
"It's got nothing to do with that!" said Ron, her cheeks reddening. "I just think it's very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don't even know what they're for, and stop talking about 'the Prince' as if it's his title, I bet it's just a stupid nickname, and it doesn't seem as though he was a very nice person to me!"
"I don't see where you get that from," said Ron heatedly. "If he'd been a budding Death Eater he wouldn't have been boasting about being 'half-blood,' would he?"
Even as he said it, Ron remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later.
"The Death Eaters can't all be pure-blood, there aren't enough pure-blood wizards left," said Ron stubbornly. "I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It's only Muggle-borns they hate, they'd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up."
"There is no way they'd let me be a Death Eater!" said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Ron and hitting Ron Weasley on the head. "My whole family are blood traitors! That's as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!"
"And they'd love to have me," said Ron sarcastically. "We'd be best pals if they didn't keep trying to do me in."
This made Ron laugh; even Ron gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ron.
"Hey, Ron, I'm supposed to give you this."
It was a scroll of parchment with Ron's name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing.
"Thanks, Ron. . . It's Weasley's next lesson!" Ron told Ron and Ron, pulling open the parchment and quickly read-ing its contents.
"Monday evening!" He felt suddenly light and happy. "Want to join us in Hogsmeade, Ron?" he asked.
"I'm going with Ron -- might see you there," she replied, waving at them as she left.
Weasley was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Weasley was triple-checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.
"What does it matter if we're smuggling Dark stuff OUT?" demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. "Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?"
His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.
The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Ron wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. More than once Ron wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko's Joke Shop had been boarded up, Ron took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a
thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Ron and Ron staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.
"Thank God," shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffee-scented air. "Let's stay here all afternoon."
"Ron, m'boy!" said a booming voice from behind them.
"Oh no," muttered Ron. The three of them turned to see Professor Weasley, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop.
"Ron, that's three of my little suppers you've missed now!" said Weasley, poking him genially in the chest. "It won't do, m'boy, I'm determined to have you! Miss Weasley loves them, don't you?"
"Yes," said Ron helplessly, "they're really --"
"So why don't you come along, Ron?" demanded Weasley.
"Well, I've had Quidditch practice, Professor," said Ron, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Weasley had sent him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ron, imagining Ron shut up with Weasley and Weasley.
"Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all the hard work!" said Weasley. "But a little recreation never hurt any body. Now, how about Monday night, you can't possibly want to practice in this weather...."
"I can't, Professor, I've got -- er -- an appointment with Professor Weasley that evening."
"Unlucky again!" cried Weasley dramatically. "Ah, well . . . you can't evade me forever, Ron!"
And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.
"I can't believe you've wriggled out of another one," said Ron, shaking her head. "They're not that bad, you know. . . They're even quite fun sometimes. . . ." But then she caught sight of Ron's expression. "Oh, look -- they've got deluxe sugar quills -- those would last hours!"
Glad that Ron had changed the subject, Ron showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Ron asked him where he wanted to go next.
"Let's go to the Three Broomsticks," said Ron. "It'll be warm."
They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Ron recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog's Head. As Ron, Ron, and Ron drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Ron realized who the man was.
"Ron!"
The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.
"Oh, 'ello, 'Arry," said Ron Weasley, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. "Well, don't let me keep ya."
And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.
"Are you selling this stuff?" asked Ron, watching Ron grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground.
"Oh, well, gotta scrape a living," said Ron. "Gimme that!"
Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.
"Hang on," Ron said slowly. "This looks familiar --"
"Thank you!" said Ron, snatching the goblet out of Ron's hand and stuffing it back into the case. "Well, I'll see you all _ OUCH!"
Ron had pinned Ron against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand.
"Ron!" squealed Ron.
"You took that from Sinus's house," said Ron, who was almost nose to nose with Ron and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. "That had the Weasley family crest on it."
"I -- no -- what -- ?" spluttered Ron, who was slowly turning purple.
"What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?" snarled Ron.
"I -- no -- "
"Give it to me!"
"Ron, you mustn't!" shrieked Ron, as Ron started to turn blue.
There was a bang, and Ron felt his hands fly off Ron's throat. Gasping and spluttering, Ron seized his fallen case, then -- CRACK-- he Disapparated.
Ron swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Ron had gone.
"COME BACK, YOU THIEVING -- !"
"There's no point, Ron." Weasley had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.
"Ron will probably be in London by now. There's no point yelling."
"He's nicked Ron's stuff! Roned it!"
"Yes, but still," said Weasley, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. "You should get out of the cold."
She watched them go through the door of the Three Broom-sticks. The moment he was inside, Ron burst out, "He was nicking Ron's stuff!"
"I know, Ron, but please don't shout, people are staring," whispered Ron. "Go and sit down, I'll get you a drink."
Ron was still fuming when Ron returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.
"Can't the Order control Ron?" Ron demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. "Can't they at least stop him stealing everything that's not fixed down when he's at headquarters?"
"Shh!" said Ron desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Ron with great interest, and Weasley was lolling against a pillar not far away. "Ron, I'd be annoyed too, I know it's your things he's stealing--"
Ron gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
"Yeah, it's my stuff!" he said. "No wonder he wasn't pleased to see me! Well, I'm going to tell Weasley what's going on, he's the only one who scares Ron."
"Good idea," whispered Ron, clearly pleased that Ron was calming down. "Ron, what are you staring at?"
"Nothing," said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Ron knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive bar-maid, Ron Ron, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.
"I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky," said Ron waspishly.
Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Ron was thinking about Ron, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Ron drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar. The moment Ron drained the last drops in his bottle she said, "Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?"
The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, then followed Ron Weasley and a friend out of the pub and back up the High Street. Ron's thoughts strayed to Ron as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Ron, because she and Ron were cozily closeted in Ron Puddifoot's Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.
It was a little while before Ron became aware that the voices of Ron Weasley and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder. Ron squinted at their indistinct figures. The
two girls were having an argument about something Ron was holding in her hand. "It's nothing to do with you, Leanne!" Ron heard Ron say.
They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Ron's glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Ron was holding; Ron tugged it back and the package fell to the ground.
At once, Ron rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression. Ron, Ron, Ron, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.
Then, six feet above the ground, Ron let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Ron's ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Ron, Ron, and Ron rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Ron's legs, she fell on top of them; Ron and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognize any of them.
Ron looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.
"Stay there!" he shouted at the others over the howling wind. "I'm going for help!"
He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Ron had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.
"Weasley!" he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen.
"Ron!" said Weasley, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. "Jus' bin visitin' Ron, he's comin' on so well yeh wouldn' --"
"Weasley, someone's hurt back there, or cursed, or something --"
"Wha ?" said Weasley, bending lower to hear what Ron was saying over the raging wind.
"Someone's been cursed!" bellowed Ron.
"Cursed? Who's bin cursed -- not Ron? Ron?"
"No, it's not them, it's Ron Weasley -- this way . . ."
Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find the little group of people around Ron, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ron, Ron, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her.
"Get back!" shouted Weasley. "Lemme see her!"
"Something's happened to her!" sobbed Leanne. "I don't know what --"
Weasley stared at Ron for a second, then without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Ron's piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind.
Ron hurried over to Ron's wailing friend and put an arm around her.
"It's Leanne, isn't it?"
The girl nodded.
"Did it just happen all of a sudden, or -- ?"
"It was when that package tore," sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand out-stretched, but Ron seized his arm and pulled him back.
"Don't touch it!"
He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper.
"I've seen that before," said Ron, staring at the thing. "It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Ron must have touched it." He looked up at Leanne, who had started to shake uncontrollably. "How did Ron get hold of this?"
"Well, that's why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it. ... Oh no, oh no, I bet she'd been Imperiused and I didn't realize!"
Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Ron patted her shoulder gently.
"She didn't say who'd given it to her, Leanne?"
"No . . . she wouldn't tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn't listen and . . . and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and -- and --"
Leanne let out a wail of despair.
"We'd better get up to school," said Ron, her arm still around Leanne. "We'll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . ."
Ron hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ron's gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up.
"We'll need to show this to Ron Weasley," he said.
As they followed Ron and Leanne up the road, Ron was thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer.
"Weasley knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!" ,
"I -- I dunno, Ron," said Ron hesitantly. "Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn't that girl say Ron got it in the girls' bathroom?"
"She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn't necessarily get it in the bathroom itself--"
"Weasley!" said Ron warningly.
Ron looked up. Sure enough, Professor Weasley was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.
"Weasley says you four saw what happened to Ron Weasley -- upstairs to my office at once, please! What's that you're holding, Weasley?"
"It's the thing she touched," said Ron.
"Good lord," said Professor Weasley, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Ron. "No, no, Weasley, they're with me!" she added hastily, as Weasley came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. "Take this necklace to Professor Weasley at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!"
Ron and the others followed Professor Weasley upstairs and into her office. The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. Professor Weasley closed the door and swept around her desk to face Ron, Ron, Ron, and the still sobbing Leanne.
"Well?" she said sharply. "What happened?"
Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor Weasley how Ron had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Ron had seemed a little odd, and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there was no getting another word out of her.
"All right," said Professor Weasley, not unkindly, "go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Ron Weasley to give you something for shock."
When she had left the room, Professor Weasley turned back to Ron, Ron, and Ron.
"What happened when Ron touched the necklace?"
"She rose up in the air," said Ron, before either Ron or Ron could speak, "and then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Weasley, please?"
"The headmaster is away until Monday, Weasley," said Professor Weasley, looking surprised.
"Away?" Ron repeated angrily.
"Yes, Weasley, away!" said Professor Weasley tartly. "But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I'm sure!"
For a split second, Ron hesitated. Professor Weasley did not invite confidences; Weasley, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at.
"I think Ron Weasley gave Ron that necklace, Professor."
On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Ron shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Ron.
"That is a very serious accusation, Weasley," said Professor Weasley, after a shocked pause. "Do you have any proof?"
"No," said Ron, "but..." and he told her about following Weasley to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had over-heard between him and Mr. Borgin.
When he had finished speaking, Professor Weasley looked slightly confused.
"Weasley took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?"
"No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn't have it with him. But that's not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace --"
"You saw Weasley leaving the shop with a similar package?"
"No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him --"
"But Ron," Ron interrupted, "Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Weasley said no --"
"Because he didn't want to touch it, obviously!" said Ron angrily.
"What he actually said was, 'How would I look carrying that down the street?'" said Ron.
"Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace," interjected Ron.
"Oh, Ron," said Ron despairingly, "it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn't have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street -- and in any case," she pressed on loudly, before Ron could interrupt, "I asked Borgin about the necklace, don't you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Weasley had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn't say it was already sold or anything --"
"Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn't going to tell you -- anyway, Weasley could've sent off for it since --"
"That's enough!" said Professor Weasley, as Ron opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. "Weasley, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Weasley purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people --"
"-- that's what I said --" muttered Ron.
"-- and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge --"
"But --"
"-- and what is more," said Professor Weasley, with an air of awful finality, "Mr. Weasley was not in Hogsmeade today."
Ron gaped at her, deflating.
"How do you know, Professor?"
"Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Weasley," she said as she marched past them, "but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Ron Weasley. Good day to you all."
She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word.
Ron was angry with the other two for siding with Weasley; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.
"So who do you reckon Ron was supposed to give the necklace to?" asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room.
"Goodness only knows," said Ron. "But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace."
"It could've been meant for loads of people," said Ron. "Weasley -- the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Weasley -- Weasley reckons Weasley really wanted him and they can't be pleased that he's sided with Weasley. Or --"
"Or you," said Ron, looking troubled.
"Couldn't have been," said Ron, "or Ron would've just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn't she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Weasley searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Weasley told her to take it into the castle?"
"Ron, Weasley wasn't in Hogsmeade!" said Ron, actually stamping her foot in frustration.
"He must have used an accomplice, then," said Ron. "Weasley or Weasley -- or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he'll have loads better cronies than Weasley and Weasley now he's joined up --"
Ron and Ron exchanged looks that plainly said There's no point arguing with him.
"Dilligrout," said Ron firmly as they reached the Ron Weasley.
The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Ron's fate had not yet spread.
"It wasn't a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it," said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. "The curse didn't even make it into the castle. Not what you'd call foolproof."
"You're right," said Ron, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. "It wasn't very well thought-out at all."
"But since when has Weasley been one of the world's great thinkers?" asked Ron.
Neither Ron nor Ron answered him.
Chapter 13: The Secret Weasley
Ron was removed to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Ron, Ron, Ron, and Leanne seemed to know that Ron herself had not been the intended target.
"Oh, and Weasley knows, of course," said Ron to Ron and Ron, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Ron mentioned his Weasley-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.
Ron had wondered whether Weasley would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday night's lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Weasley's office at eight o'clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Weasley looking unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Ron to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling.
"You have had a busy time while I have been away," Weasley said. "I believe you witnessed Ron's accident."
"Yes, sir. How is she?"
"Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin; there was a
tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Weasley was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse --"
"Why him?" asked Ron quickly. "Why not Ron Weasley?"
"Impertinent," said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas  Weasley, Ron's great-great-grandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. "I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day."
"Yes, thank you, Phineas," said Weasley quellingly. "Professor Weasley knows much more about the Dark Arts than Ron Weasley, Ron. Anyway, the St. Mungo's staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Ron will make a full recovery in time."
"Where were you this weekend, sir?" Ron asked, disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas , who hissed softly.
"I would rather not say just now," said Weasley. "However, I shall tell you in due course."
"You will?" said Ron, startled.
"Yes, I expect so," said Weasley, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.
"Sir," said Ron tentatively, "I met Ron in Hogsmeade."
"Ah yes, I am already aware that Ron has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt," said Weasley, frowning a little. "He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Ron's old possessions."
"That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Weasley heirlooms?" said Phineas , incensed; and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
"Professor," said Ron, after a short pause, "did Professor Weasley tell you what I told her after Ron got hurt? About Ron Weasley?"
"She told me of your suspicions, yes," said Weasley.
"And do you -- ?"
"I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Ron's accident," said Weasley. "But what concerns me now, Ron, is our lesson."
Ron felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second? However, he said no more about Ron Weasley, but watched as Weasley poured
the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his long-fingered hands.
"You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Weasley's beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Ron Weasley, had abandoned his witch wife, Ron, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton. Ron was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Weasley."
"How do you know she was in London, sir?"
"Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke," said Weasley, "who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing."
He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Ron had seen him swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes.
"Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags and pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had been Weasley's. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time, 'Oh, this was Merlin's, this was, his favorite teapot,' but when I looked at it, it had his
mark all right, and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough priceless. She didn't seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!"
Weasley gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come.
"He only gave her ten Galleons?" said Ron indignantly.
"Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity," said Weasley. "So we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Ron was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Ron's treasured family heirlooms."
"But she could do magic!" said Ron impatiently. "She could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn't she?"
"Ah," said Weasley, "perhaps she could. But it is my belief--I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right -- that when her husband abandoned her, Ron stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Ron refused to raise her wand even to save her own life."
"She wouldn't even stay alive for her son?"
Weasley raised his eyebrows. "Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Weasley?"
"No," said Ron quickly, "but she had a choice, didn't she, not like my mother --"
"Your mother had a choice too," said Weasley gently. "Yes, Ron Weasley chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Ron. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother's courage. And now, if you will stand ..."
"Where are we going?" Ron asked, as Weasley joined him at the front of the desk.
"This time," said Weasley, "we are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Ron ..."
Ron bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . . Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he and Weasley were standing in a bustling, old-fashioned London street.
"There I am," said Weasley brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart.
This younger Ron Weasley's long hair and beard were auburn. Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing.
"Nice suit, sir," said Ron, before he could stop himself, but Weasley merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron.
"Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Weasley, who, I believe, is the matron here?"
"Oh," said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Weasley's eccentric appearance. "Um. . . just a mo' . . . MRS. Weasley!" she bellowed over her shoulder.
Ron heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to Weasley. "Come in, she's on 'er way."
Weasley stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Ron and the older Weasley
followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Weasley.
". . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Rony Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley's oozing all over his sheets -- chicken pox on top of everything else," she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Weasley and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold.
"Good afternoon," said Weasley, holding out his hand. Mrs. Weasley simply gaped.
"My name is Ron Weasley. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today."
Mrs. Weasley blinked. Apparently deciding that Weasley was not a hallucination, she said feebly, "Oh yes. Well -- well then -- you'd better come into my room. Yes."
She led Weasley into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. She invited Weasley to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously.
"I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Ron Weasley and arrangements for his future," said Weasley.
"Are you family?" asked Mrs. Weasley.
"No, I am a teacher," said Weasley. "I have come to offer Ron a place at my school."
"What school's this, then?"
"It is called Hogwarts," said Weasley.
"And how come you're interested in Ron?"
"We believe he has qualities we are looking for."
"You mean he's won a scholarship? How can he have done? He's never been entered for one."
"Well, his name has been down for our school since birth --"
"Who registered him? His parents?"
There was no doubt that Mrs. Weasley was an inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Weasley thought so too, for Ron now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Weasley's desktop.
"Here," said Weasley, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, "I think this will make everything clear."
Mrs. Weasley's eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment.
"That seems perfectly in order," she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before.
"Er -- may I offer you a glass of gin?" she said in an extra-refined voice.
"Thank you very much," said Weasley, beaming.
It soon became clear that Mrs. Weasley was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Weasley for the first time, and he didn't hesitate to press his advantage.
"I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Ron Weasley's history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?"
"That's right," said Mrs. Weasley, helping herself to more gin. "I remember it clear as anything, because I'd just started here myself. New Year's Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front steps. Well, she
wasn't the first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour."
Mrs. Weasley nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin.
"Did she say anything before she died?" asked Weasley. "Anything about the boy's father, for instance?"
"Now, as it happens, she did," said Mrs. Weasley, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story. "I remember she said to me, 'I hope he looks like his papa,' and I won't lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty -- and then she told me he was to be named Ron, for his father, and Ron, for her father -- yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus -- and she said the boy's surname was to be Weasley. And she died soon after that without another word.
"Well, we named him just as she'd said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Ron nor Ron nor any kind of Weasley ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and he's been here ever since."
Mrs. Weasley helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, "He's a funny boy."
"Yes," said Weasley. "I thought he might be."
"He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then, when he got a little older, he was. . . odd."
"Odd in what way?" asked Weasley gently.
"Well, he --"
But Mrs. Weasley pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Weasley over her gin glass.
"He's definitely got a place at your school, you say?"
"Definitely," said Weasley.
"And nothing I say can change that?"
"Nothing," said Weasley.
"You'll be taking him away, whatever?"
"Whatever," repeated Weasley gravely.
She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, "He scares the other children."
"You mean he is a bully?" asked Weasley.
"I think he must be," said Mrs. Weasley, frowning slightly, "but it's very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty things ..."
Weasley did not press her, though Ron could tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still.
"Rony Stubbs's rabbit. . . well, Ron said he didn't do it and I don't see how he could have done, but even so, it didn't hang itself from the rafters, did it?"
"I shouldn't think so, no," said Weasley quietly.
"But I'm jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Rony had argued the day before. And then" -- Mrs. Weasley took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this time -- "on the summer outing -- we take them out, you know, once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside -- well, Amy Benson and Ron Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was that they'd gone into a cave with Ron Weasley. He swore they'd just gone exploring, but something happened in there, I'm sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of things, funny things. . . ."
She looked around at Weasley again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. "I don't think many people will be sorry to see the back of him."
"You understand, I'm sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?" said Weasley. "He will have to return here, at the very least, every summer."
"Oh, well, that's better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker," said Mrs. Weasley with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and Ron was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though two-thirds of the gin was now gone. "I suppose you'd like to see him?"
"Very much," said Weasley, rising too.
She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed. The orphans, Ron saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up.
"Here we are," said Mrs. Weasley, as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She knocked twice and entered.
"Ron? You've got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton -- sorry, Dunderbore. He's come to tell you -- well, I'll let him do it."
Ron and the two Weasleys entered the room, and Mrs. Weasley closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old
wardrobe and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him, holding a book.
There was no trace of the Weasleys in Ron Weasley's face. Ron had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Weasley's eccentric appearance. There was a moment's silence.
"How do you do, Ron?" said Weasley, walking forward and holding out his hand.
The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Weasley drew up the hard wooden chair beside Weasley, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.
"I am Professor Weasley."
"'Professor'?" repeated Weasley. He looked wary. "Is that like 'doctor'? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look at me?"
He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Weasley had just left.
"No, no," said Weasley, smiling.
"I don't believe you," said Weasley. "She wants me looked at, doesn't she? Tell the truth!"
He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Weasley, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Weasley stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still.
"Who are you?"
"I have told you. My name is Professor Weasley and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school -- your new school, if you would like to come."
Weasley's reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Weasley, looking furious.
"You can't kid me! The asylum, that's where you're from, isn't it? 'Professor,' yes, of course -- well, I'm not going, see? That old cat's the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Ron Bishop, and you can ask them, they'll tell you!
"I am not from the asylum," said Weasley patiently. "I am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you --"
"I'd like to see them try," sneered Weasley.
"Hogwarts," Weasley went on, as though he had not heard Weasley's last words, "is a school for people with special abilities --"
"I'm not mad!"
"I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It is a school of magic."
There was silence. Weasley had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Weasley's, as though trying to catch one of them lying.
"Magic?" he repeated in a whisper.
"That's right," said Weasley.
"It's. . . it's magic, what I can do?"
"What is it that you can do?"
"All sorts," breathed Weasley. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. "I can make filings move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to."
His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in prayer.
"I knew I was different," he whispered to his own quivering fingers. "I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something."
"Well, you were quite right," said Weasley, who was no longer smiling, but watching Weasley intently. "You are a wizard."
Weasley lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.
"Are you a wizard too?"
"Yes, I am."
"Prove it," said Weasley at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said, "Tell the truth."
Weasley raised his eyebrows. "If, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwarts--"
"Of course I am!"
"Then you will address me as 'Professor' or 'sir.'"
Weasley's expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, "I'm sorry, sir. I meant -- please, Professor, could you show me -- ?"
Ron was sure that Weasley was going to refuse, that he would tell Weasley there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Weasley drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.
The wardrobe burst into flames.
Weasley jumped to his feet; Ron could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there. But even as Weasley rounded on Weasley, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.
Weasley stared from the wardrobe to Weasley; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. "Where can I get one of them?"
"All in good time," said Weasley. "I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe."
And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For the first time, Weasley looked frightened.
"Open the door," said Weasley.
Weasley hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.
"Take it out," said Weasley.
Weasley took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.
"Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?" asked Weasley.
Weasley threw Weasley a long, clear, calculating look. "Yes, I suppose so, sir," he said finally, in an expressionless voice.
"Open it," said Weasley.
Weasley took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them. Ron, who had expected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets.
"You will return them to their owners with your apologies," said Weasley calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. "I shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts."
Weasley did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Weasley. At last he said in a colorless voice, "Yes, sir."
"At Hogwarts," Weasley went on, "we teach you not only to use magic, but to control it. You have -- inadvertently, I am sure -- been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic -- yes, there is a Ministry -- will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws."
"Yes, sir," said Weasley again.
It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Weasley and said baldly, "I haven't got any money."
"That is easily remedied," said Weasley, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. "There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require
assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but --"
"Where do you buy spellbooks?" interrupted Weasley, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Weasley, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon,
"In Diagon Alley," said Weasley. "I have your list of books and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything --"
"You're coming with me?" asked Weasley, looking up.
"Certainly, if you --"
"I don't need you," said Weasley. "I'm used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley -- sir?" he added, catching Weasley's eye.
Ron thought that Weasley would insist upon accompanying Weasley, but once again he was surprised. Weasley handed Weasley the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after telling Weasley exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, "You will be able to see it, although Muggles around you -- non-magical people, that is -- will not. Ask for Ron the barman -- easy enough to remember, as he shares your name --"
Weasley gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly.
"You dislike the name 'Ron'?"
"There are a lot of Rons," muttered Weasley. Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, "Was my father a wizard? He was called Ron Weasley too, they've told me."
"I'm afraid I don't know," said Weasley, his voice gentle.
"My mother can't have been magic, or she wouldn't have died," said Weasley, more to himself than Weasley. "It must've been him. So -- when I've got all my stuff-- when do I come to this Hogwarts?"
"All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope," said Weasley. "You will leave from King's Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too."
Weasley nodded. Weasley got to his feet and held out his hand again. Taking it, Weasley said, "I can speak to snakes. I found out when we've been to the country on trips -- they find me, they whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?"
Ron could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment, determined to impress.
"It is unusual," said Weasley, after a moment's hesitation, "but not unheard of."
His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Weasley's face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Weasley was at the door.
"Good-bye, Ron. I shall see you at Hogwarts."
"I think that will do," said the white-haired Weasley at Ron's side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-day office.
"Sit down," said Weasley, landing beside Ron.
Ron obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.
"He believed it much quicker than I did -- I mean, when you told him he was a wizard," said Ron. "I didn't believe Weasley at first, when he told me."
"Yes, Weasley was perfectly ready to believe that he was -- to use his word -- 'special,'" said Weasley.
"Did you know -- then?" asked Ron.
"Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?" said Weasley. "No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others' sake as much as his.
"His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and -- most interestingly and ominously of all -- he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . . 'I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .'"
"And he was a Parselmouth," interjected Ron.
"Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.
"Time is making fools of us again," said Weasley, indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. "But before we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings.
"Firstly, I hope you noticed Weasley's reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, 'Ron'?"
Ron nodded.
"There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of ‘Lord Weasley' behind which he has been hidden for so long.
"I trust that you also noticed that Ron Weasley was already highly self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Weasley is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Weasley has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
"And lastly -- I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Ron -- the young Ron Weasley liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.
"And now, it really is time for bed."
Ron got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell I upon the little table on which Ron Weasley's ring had rested last I time, but the ring was no longer there.
"Yes, Ron?" said Weasley, for Ron had come to a halt.
"The ring's gone," said Ron, looking around. "But I thought I you might have the mouth organ or something."
Weasley beamed at him, peering over the top of his halfw moon spectacles.
"Very astute, Ron, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ."
And on that enigmatic note he waved to Ron, who understood himself to be dismissed.
Chapter 14: Felix Felicis
Ron had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and Ron about his lesson with Weasley over breakfast for fear of being over-heard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend’s brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.
"Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who," said Ron qui-etly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. "But I still don't get why Weasley's showing you all this. I mean, it's really interesting and everything, but what's the point?"
"Dunno," said Ron, inserting a gum shield. "But he says its all important and it'll help me survive."
"I think it's fascinating," said Ron earnestly. "It makes absolute sense to know as much about Weasley as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?"
"So how was Weasley's latest party?" Ron asked her thickly through the gum shield.
"Oh, it was quite fun, really," said Ron, now putting on protective goggles. "I mean, he drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he
absolutely fawns on Weasley because he's so well connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones."
"Gwenog Jones?" said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles. "The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?"
"That's right," said Ron. "Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but --"
"Quite enough chat over here!" said Professor Weasley briskly, bustling over and looking stern. "You're lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Ron's already got his first pod!"
They looked around; sure enough, there sat Ron with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.
"Okay, Professor, we're starting now!" said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, "should ve used Muffliato, Ron."
"No, we shouldn't!" said Ron at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells. "Well, come on ... we'd better get going. ..."
She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.
It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Ron's hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Ron succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Ron plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Ron and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermi-one snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Ron's. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.
"You know, I don't think I'll be having any of these in my garden when I've got my own place," said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.
"Pass me a bowl," said Ron, holding the pulsating pod at arm's length; Ron handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.
"Don't be squeamish, squeeze it out, they're best when they're fresh!" called Professor Weasley.
"Anyway," said Ron, continuing their interrupted conver-sation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, "Weasley's going to have a Christmas party, Ron, and there's no way you'll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come."
Ron groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, "And this is another party just for Weasley's favorites, is it?"
"Just for the Slug Club, yes," said Ron.
The pod flew out from under Ron's fingers and hit the green house glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Weasley's head and knocking off her old, patched hat. Ron went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Ron was saying, "Look, I didn't make up the name 'Slug Club' --"
"'Slug Club,'"repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Weasley. "It's pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don't you try hooking up with Weasley, then Weasley can make you King and Queen Slug --"
"We're allowed to bring guests," said Ron, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, "and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it's that stupid then I won't bother!"
Ron suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unno-ticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and be-gan to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation.
"You were going to ask me?" asked Ron, in a completely differ-ent voice.
"Yes," said Ron angrily. "But obviously if you'd rather 1 hooked up with Weasley ..."
There was a pause while Ron continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.
"No, I wouldn't," said Ron, in a very quiet voice.
Ron missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.
‘"Reparo,"' he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Ron to Ron's presence. Ron looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of "Flesh-Eating Trees of the World" to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.
"Hand that over, Ron," said Ron hurriedly. "It says we're supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . ."
Ron passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump. It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Ron, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it. ... He and
Ron were now too em-barrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Ron started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Ron remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn't split up? What if they became like Ron and Ron, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?
"Gotcha!" yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Ron managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.
The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Weasley's party. Although Ron watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Ron did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Ron supposed he would just have to wait to see what
happened under the influence of butterbeer in Weasley's dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries.
Ron Weasley was still in St. Mungo's Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising Weasley team Ron had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept putting off replacing Ron in the hope that she would return, but their opening match
against Weasley was loom-ing, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play.
Ron did not think he could stand another full-House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cor-nered Ron Ron after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Ron's creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.
"Are you still interested in playing Chaser?"
"Wha -- ? Yeah, of course!" said Ron excitedly. Over Ron’s shoulder, Ron saw Ron Finnegan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Ron would have pre-ferred not to have to ask Ron to play was that he knew Ron would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Ron had outflown Ron at the tryouts.
"Well then, you're in," said Ron. "There's a practice tonight, seven o'clock."
"Right," said Ron. "Cheers, Ron! Blimey, I can't wait to tell Ron!"
He sprinted out of the room, leaving Ron and Ron alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Ron's head as one of Ron's canaries whizzed over them.
Ron was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Ron’s substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Ron had now chosen two of his class-mates for the team. As Ron had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Weasley. If Weasley won, Ron knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost. . . well, Ron thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings. . . .
Ron had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Ron fly that evening; he worked well with Ron and Ron. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron.
Ron had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortu-nately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ron, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Ron Weasley in the mouth.
"It was an accident, I'm sorry, Ron, really sorry!" Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping blood everywhere. "I just --"
"Panicked," Ron said angrily, landing next to Ron and examining her fat lip. "You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!"
"I can fix that," said Ron, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Rons mouth, and saying "Episkey." "And Ron, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team --"
"Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should --"
Ron forced himself not to laugh.
"In the air, everyone, let's go. . . ."
Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Ron did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match.
"Good work, everyone, I think we'll flatten Weasley," he said bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.
"I played like a sack of dragon dung," said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ron.
"No, you didn't," said Ron firmly. "You're the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves."
He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Ron pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Weasley Tower, however, they found themselves looking at Ron and Ron, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together.
It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Ron's stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Ron into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron's voice as though from a great distance away.
"Oi!"
Ron and Ron broke apart and looked around. "What?" said Ron.
"I don't want to find my own sister snogging people in public!" "This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!" said Ron.
Ron was looking embarrassed. He gave Ron a shifty grin that Ron did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roar-ing for Ron's instant dismissal from the team.
"Er . . . c'mon, Ron," said Ron, "let's go back to the common room. ..."
"You go!" said Ron. "I want a word with my dear brother!" Ron left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene.
"Right," said Ron, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, "let's get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron --" "Yeah, it is!" said Ron, just as angrily. "D' you think I want peo-ple saying my sister's a --"
"A what?" shouted Ron, drawing her wand. "A what, exactly?" "He doesn't mean anything, Ron --" said Ron automati-cally, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ron's words. "Oh yes he does!" she said, flaring up at Ron. "Just because he's never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he's ever had is from our Auntie Weasley --"
"Shut your mouth!" bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon.
"No, I will not!" yelled Ron, beside herself. "I've seen you with Phlegm, hoping she'll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it's pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done your self, you wouldn't mind so much that everyone else does it!"
Ron had pulled out his wand too; Ron stepped swiftly between them.
"You don't know what you're talking about!" Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ron around Ron, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. "Just because I don't do it in public -- !"
Ron screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Ron out of the way.
"Been kissing Ron, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Weasley stashed under your pillow?" You --
A streak of orange light flew under Rons left arm and missed Ron by inches; Ron pushed Ron up against the wall.
"Don't be stupid --"
"Ron's snogged Ron Weasley!" shouted Ron, who sounded close to tears now. "And Ron snogged Ron Weasley, it's only you who acts like it's something disgusting, Ron, and that's because you've got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!"
And with that, she stormed away. Ron quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breath-ing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Rich's cat, appeared around the cor-ner, which broke the tension.
"C'mon," said Ron, as the sound of Weasley's shuffling feet reached their ears.
They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. "Oi, out of the way!" Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.
Ron hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt dis-oriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. It's just because she's Ron’s sister, he told himself. You just didn't like seeing her kissing Ron because she's Ron's sister. . . .
But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same de-serted corridor with himself kissing Ron instead. . . . The mon-ster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Ron, shouting things like "betrayal of trust" . . . "supposed to be my friend" . . .
"D'you think Ron did snog Weasley?" Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Ron Weasley. Ron gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he and Ron were quite alone -- "What?" he said confusedly. "Oh ... er ..." The honest answer was "yes," but he did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Ron's face.
"Dilligrout," he said darkly to the Ron Weasley, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room.
Neither of them mentioned Ron or Ron again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in si-lence, each absorbed in his own thoughts,
Ron lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ron were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Ron and Phlegm? He had known Ron for years now. ... It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Ron limb from limb for kissing her... No ... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .
Ron gave a great grunting snore.
She's Ron's sister, Ron told himself firmly. Ron's sister. She's out-of-bounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ron.
Ron awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ron and Ron, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Ron with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Ron spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Ron with no success; finally, Ron departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys' dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him.
To Ron’s dismay, Ron's new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturdays match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Ron Weasley to tears.
"You shut up and leave her alone!" shouted Peakes, who was about two-thirds Ron's height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.
"ENOUGH!" bellowed Ron, who had seen Ron glowering in Ron’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accom-plished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene be-fore things got out of hand. "Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Ron, pull yourself together, you played really well today, Ron . . ." he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, "you're my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I'm going to kick you off the team."
He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom. all the fight went out of him and he said, "I resign. I'm pathetic."
"You're not pathetic and you're not resigning!" said Ron fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. "You can save any-thing when you're on form, it's a mental problem you've got!" "You calling me mental?" "Yeah, maybe I am!"
They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily. "I know you haven't got any time to find another Keeper, so I'll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I'm tak-ing myself off the team."
Nothing Ron said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron's confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Ron to notice. Ron persisted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Ron tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.
Ron lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Cap-tain, but he was determined to beat Ron Weasley at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim. . . .
If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull him-self together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . some-thing that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .
And the answer came to Ron in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.
Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Weasleys hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Weasley team entered the Great Hall. Ron glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.
The Weasley table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Ron and Ron approached. Ron grinned and waved; Ron gri-maced weakly and shook his head.
"Cheer up, Ron!" called Ron. "I know you'll be brilliant!" : Ron ignored her.
"Tea?" Ron asked him. "Coffee? Pumpkin juice?" "Anything," said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.
A few minutes later Ron, who had become so tired of Ron's recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.
"How are you both feeling?" she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron's head.
"Fine," said Ron, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. "There you go, Ron. Drink up."
Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Ron spoke
sharply.
"Don't drink that, Ron!"
Both Ron and Ron looked up at her.
"Why not?" said Ron.
Ron was now staring at Ron as though she could not be-lieve her eyes.
"You just put something in that drink."
"Excuse me?" said Ron.
"You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron's drink. You've got the bottle in your hand right now!"
"I dont know what you're talking about," said Ron, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.
"Ron, I warn you, don't drink it!" Ron said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and said, "Stop bossing me around, Ron."
She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Ron could hear her, she hissed, "You should be expelled for that. I'd never have believed it of you, Ron!"
"Look who's talking," he whispered back. "Confunded anyone lately?"
She stormed up the table away from them. Ron watched her go without regret. Ron had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who was smacking his lips.
"Nearly time/' said Ron blithely.
The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium.
"Pretty lucky the weathers this good, eh?" Ron asked Ron.
"Yeah," said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.
Ron and Ron were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.
"Conditions look ideal," said Ron, ignoring Ron. "And guess what? That Weasley Chaser Vaisey -- he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he's too sore to play! And even better than that -- Weasley's gone off sick too!"
"What?" said Ron, wheeling around to stare at her. "He's ill? What's wrong with him?"
"No idea, but it's great for us," said Ron brightly. "They're playing Harper instead; he's in my year and he's an idiot."
Ron smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Weasley had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Weasleys better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking?
"Fishy, isn't it?" he said in an undertone to Ron. "Weasley not playing?"
"Lucky, I call it," said Ron, looking slightly more animated. "And Vaisey off too, he's their best goal scorer, I didn't fancy -- hey!" he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and staring at Ron.
"What?"
"I... you . . ." Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared and excited. "My drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you didn't...?"
Ron raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, "We'll be starting in about five minutes, you'd better get your boots on."
They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Weasleys and Weasleys had taken sides too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Ron could distinctly hear the roar of Ron Weasley's famous lion-topped hat.
Ron stepped up to Ron Weasley, the referee, who was stand-ing ready to release the balls from the crate.
"Captains shake hands," she said, and Ron had his hand crushed by the new Weasley Captain, Urquhart. "Mount your brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . ."
The whistle sounded, Ron and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away.
Ron soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentator's started up.
"Well, there they go, and I think we're all surprised to see the team that Weasley's put together this year. Many thought, given Ronald Weasley's patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help. . . ."
These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Weasley end of the pitch. Ron craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator's podium. A call, skinny blond buy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Ron Weasley's; Ron recognized Ron Weasley, a Weasley player whom he heartily disliked.
"Oh, and here comes Weasley's first attempt on goal, it's Urquhart streaking down the pitch and --"
Rons stomach turned over.
"-- Weasley saves it, well, he's bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose. . . ."
"That's right, Weasley, he is," muttered Ron, grinning to him-self, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.
With half an hour of the game gone, Weasley were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ron having scored four of Weasley's six goals. This effectively stopped Ron won-dering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Ron liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.
"Of course, Coote isn't really the usual build for a Beater," said Ron loftily, "they've generally got a bit more muscle --"
"Hit a Bludger at him!" Ron called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Ron in the opposite direc-tion. Ron was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark.
It seemed as though Weasley could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a
rousing chorus of the old favorite "Weasley Is Our King," he pre-tended to conduct them from on high.
"Thinks he's something special today, doesn't he?" said a snide voice, and Ron was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. "Your blood-traitor pal..." Ron Weasley's back was turned, and though Weasleys be-low shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had already sped off. His shoulder aching, Ron raced after him, de-termined to ram him back. ...
"And I think Harper of Weasley's seen the Snitch!" said Ron Weasley through his megaphone. "Yes, he's certainly seen something Weasley hasn't!"
Weasley really was an idiot, thought Ron, hadn't he noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the , sky -- Weasley was right and Ron was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; he had spotted what Ron had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.
Ron accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Weasley's commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Weasley was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Weasley had lost. . . and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. ...
"Oi, Harper!" yelled Ron in desperation. "How much did Weasley pay you to come on instead of him?"
He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a dou-ble-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and shot right past it. Ron made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it.
"YES!" Hairy yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.
"Ron, where're you going?" yelled Ron, who had found hint self trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of tin1 team, but Ron sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided
with the commentators podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Weasley team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Ron was feebly stirring,: Ron heard Ron saying blithely to an irate Professor Weasley, "Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry."
Laughing, Ron broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ron, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Weasley team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air ami waving to their supporters.
The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. "Party up in the common room, Ron said!" yelled Ron exuberantly. "C'mon, Ron, Ron!"
Ron and Ron were the last two in the changing room. They were just about to leave when Ron entered. She was twisting her Weasley scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined. "I want a word with you, Ron." She took a deep breath. "Yon shouldn't have done it. You heard Weasley, its illegal." "What are you going to do, turn us in?" demanded Ron. "What are you two talking about?" asked Ron, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning, "You know perfectly well what we're talking about!" said Ron shrilly. "You spiked Rons juice with lucky potion at breakfast! I'elix Felicis!"
"No, I didn't," said Ron, turning back to face them both.
"Yes you did, Ron, and that's why everything went right, there were Weasley players missing and Ron saved everything!"
"I didn't put it in!" said Ron, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Ron had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. "I wanted Ron to think I'd done it, so I faked it when I knew you were look-ing." He looked at Ron. "You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself."
He pocketed the potion again.
"There really wasn't anything in my pumpkin juice?" Ron said, astounded. "But the weather's good. . . and Vaisey couldn't play. ... I honestly haven't been given lucky potion?" ]
Ron shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Ron, imitating her voice. "You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this morning, that's why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Ron!"
"I never said you couldn't -- Ron, you thought you'd been given it too!"
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.
"Er," said Ron into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, "shall. . . shall we go up to the party, then?"
"You go!" said Ron, blinking back tears. "I'm sick of Ron at the moment, I don't know what I'm supposed to have done. . . ."
And she stormed out of the changing room too.
Ron walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and Ron would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermi-one that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Ron Weasley, not when the offense had occurred so long ago.
Ron could not see Ron at the Weasley celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Weasley brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated him-self from Ron Weasley, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Weasley's Christmas party with him. As he was duck-ing toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ron, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Ron mewing hopefully at her heels.
"Looking for Ron?" she asked, smirking. "He's over there, the filthy hypocrite."
Ron looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Ron Weasley it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
"It looks like he's eating her face, doesn't it?" said Ron dispas-sionately. "But I suppose he's got to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Ron."
She patted him on the arm; Ron felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer. Ron trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.
Ron turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whip-ping out of sight.
He darted forward, sidestepped Ron Weasley again, and pushed open the portrait of the Ron Weasley. The corridor outside , seemed to be deserted.
"Ron?"
He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twit-tering yellow birds
circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Ron could not help admiring her spell-work at a time like this.
"Oh, hello, Ron," she said in a brittle voice. "I was just practicing."
"Yeah . . . they're -- er -- really good. ..." said Ron.
He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, "Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations."
"Er . . . does he?" said Ron.
"Don't pretend you didn't see him," said Ron. "He wasn't exactly hiding it, was -- ?"
The door behind them burst open. To Ron's horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Ron by the hand. ; '
"Oh," he said, drawing up short at the sight of Ron and Ron.
"Oops!" said Ron, and she backed out of the room, gig-gling. The door swung shut behind her.
There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Ron was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, "Hi, Ron! Wondered where you'd got to!"
Ron slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds con-tinued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.
"You shouldn't leave Ron waiting outside," she said quietly. "She'll wonder where you've gone."
She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Ron glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.
"Oppugno!" came a shriek from the doorway.
Ron spun around to see Ron pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.
"Gerremoffme!" he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Ron wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Ron thought he heard a sob before it slammed.
Chapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow
Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Weasley had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Ron went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Ron's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoe-free routes between classes.
Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Ron much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Ron had to put up with the frequent presence of Ron Weasley, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Ron found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.
Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Ron's bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.
"She can't complain," he told Ron. "She snogged Weasley. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong."
Ron did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Ron, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.
"I never promised Ron anything , " Ron mumbled. "I mean, all right, I was going to go to Weasley's Christmas party with her, but she never said... just as friends... I'm a free agent..."
Ron turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron's voice trailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Ron thought he caught the words "Weasley" and "Can't complain" again.
Ron's schedule was so full that Ron could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Ron that he did not notice what Ron was doing. Ron refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Ron generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.
"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes," said Ron, while the librarian , Ron Weasley, prowled the shelves behind them. "I really couldn't care less."
She raised her quill and dotted an 'i' so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Ron said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p rince's useful additions to Libatius B orage's text.
"And incidentally," said Ron, after a few moments, "you need to be careful."
"For the last time," said Ron, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after three-quarters of an ho u r of silence, "I am not giving back this book . I've learned more from the Half-blood p rince than Weasley or Weasley have taught me in--"
"I'm not talking about your stupid so-called prince," said Ron , giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. "I'm talki ng about earlier. I went into the girl's bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Ron Weasley , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They're all hoping they're going to get you to take them to Weasley's party, and thay all seem to have bought Ron and Ron's love potions, which I'm afraid to say probably work --"
"Why didn't you confiscate them then?" demanded Ron, it seemed extraordinary that Ron's m ania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
"They didn't have the potions with them in the bathroom," said Ron scornfully, "They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince" she gave the book another scornful look "could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I'd just invite someone to go with you, that'll stop all the others thinking they've still got a chance. It's tomor r ow night, they're getting desperate."
"There isn't anyone I want to invite," mumbled Ron, who was still not trying to think about Ron any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.
"Well, just be careful what you drink, because Ron Va ne looked like she meant business." said Ron grimly.
She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Ron wa t che d her with his mind a long way away.
"Hang on a moment," he said slowly. "I thought Weasley had banned anything bought at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes?"
"And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Weasley has banned?" asked Ron, still concentrating on her essay.
"But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school?"
"Ron and Ron send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions," said Ron. "It's part of their Owl order service."
"You know a lot about it."
Ron gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
"It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ron and me in the summer," she said coldly, "I don't go around putting potions in people's drinks... or pretending too eit h er, which is just as bad..."
"Yeah, well, never mind that," said Ron quickly. "The point is, Weasley is being fooled isn't he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn't Weasley have brought the necklace into the school --?"
"Oh, Ron... not that again..."
"Come on, why not?" demanded Ron.
"Look , " sighed Ron, "Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don't they? They're used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts. They'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace, withi n seconds. But something that's just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn ' t register -- anyway Love potions aren't d ark or dangerous -"
"Easy for you to say," muttered Ron, thinking of Ron Weasley.
"-- so it would be down to Weasley to realise it wasn't a cough potion, and he's not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from --"
Ron stopped dead; Ron had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Ron Weasley appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.
"The library is now closed," she said, "Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct -- what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?"
"It isn't the library's, it's mine!" said Ron hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.
" Spoiled!" she hissed . "Desecrated, befouled !"
"It's just a book that's been written on!" said Ron, tugging it out of her grip.
She looked as though she might have a seizure; Ron, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Ron by the arm and frogmarched him away.
"She'll ban you from the library if you're not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?"
"It's not my fault she's barking mad, Ron. Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Weasley? I've always thought there might be something between them..."
"Oh, ha ha.."
Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing w hether or not Weasley and Ron Weasley were secretly in love with each other.
"Baubles" said Ron to the Ron Weasley, this being the new, festive password.
"Same to you," said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them.
"Hi, Ron!" said Ron Weasley, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. "Fancy a gillywater?"
Ron gave him a "what-did-I-tell-you?" look over her shoulder.
"No thanks," said Ron quickly. "I don't like it much."
"Well, take these anyway," said Ron, thrusting a box into his hands. "Roncolate Cauldrons, they've got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don't like them."
"Oh-- right -- thanks a lot." said Ron, who could not think what else to say. " Er-- I ' m just going over here with ..."
He hurried off behind Ron, his voice tailing away feebly.
"Told you," said Ron succinctly, " Sooner you ask someone, sooner they'll all leave you alone and you can --"
But her face suddnly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Ron, who were i ntertwined in the same armchair.
"Well, good night, Ron" said Ron, though it was only seven o'clock in the evening, and she left for the girl s' dormitory without another word.
Ron went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Weasley's party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Ron would make up with each other before the holidays began, but
perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior...
But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Ron laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Ron jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor Weasley asked a question, which Ron and Ron found deeply amusing and which reduced Ron to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Ron, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her.
He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl's bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Ron Weasley, who was patting her vaguely on the back.
"Oh, hello, Ron , " said Ron . " D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?"
"Hi, Ron. Ron , you left your stuff..."
He held out her books.
"Oh, yes," said Ron in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. "Thank you , Ron. Well, I'd better get going..."
And she hurried off, without ever giving Ron any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any.
"She's a bit upset , " said Ron. "I thought at first it was Moaning Ron in there, but it turned out to be Ron. She said something about Ron Weasley..."
"Yeah, they've had a row," said Ron.
"He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he?" said Ron as they set off down the corridor together. "But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year."
" I s'pose , " said Ron. Ron was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. "So have you had a good term?"
"Oh, it's been al l right," said Ron. " A bit lonely without the D.A. Ron's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day --"
"How would you like to come to S lughorn's party with me tonight?"
The words were out of Ron's mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking.
Ron turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise.
"Weasley's party? With you?"
"Yeah," said Ron, "We're supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I mean..." He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. " I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don't want to..."
He was already half hoping that she didn't want to.
"O h no, I'd love to go with you as friends!" said Ron, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. "Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?"
"No" said Ron firmly, "That was a mistake. I'll get Ron to put it right for me. So I'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o'clock then . "
"AHA!" screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Ron, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them.
"Potty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!"
And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, "Potty loves Loony!"
"Nice to keep these things private," said Ron. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Ron Weasley was taking Ron Weasley to Weasley's party.
"You could've taken anyone!" said Ron in disbelief over dinner. "Anyone! And you chose Loony Weasley?"
"Don't call her that, Ron!" snapped Ron, pausing behind Ron on her way to join friends. "I'm really glad you're taking her Ron, she's so excited."
And she moved on down the table to sit with Ron. Ron tried to feel pleased that Ron was glad he was taking Ron to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Ron was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Ron noticed Ron looking at her furtively.
"You could say sorry , " suggested Ron bluntly.
"What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries?" muttered Ron.
"What did you have to imitate her for?"
"She laughed at my mustache!"
"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen."
But Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Ron had just arrived with Ron. Squeezing herself in between Ron and Ron, Ron flung her arms around Ron's neck.
"Hi, Ron," said Ron who, like Ron, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends.
"Hi," said Ron, "How're you? You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave."
"I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being," said Ron. "That Ron thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn't been anything since... Oh, hi, Ron!"
Ron positively beamed. Ron could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Ron in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Ron was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.
"Hi, Ron!" said Ron, ignoring Ron and Ron completely. "Are you going to Weasley's party tonight?"
"No invite," said Ron gloomily. "I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good... You're going, aren't you?"
"Yes, I'm meeting Ron at eight, and we're -"
There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Ron acted as though she had not seen or heard anything.
"- we're going up to the party together."
"Ron?" said Ron. "Ron Weasley, you mean?"
"That's right," said Ron sweetly. "The one who *almost*" - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - "bec a me Weasley Keeper."
"Are you going out with him, then?" asked Ron, wide-eyed.
"Oh - yes - didn't you know?" said Harmione, with a most un-Ron-ish giggle.
"No!" said Ron, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. "Wow , you like your Quidditch players, don't you? First Weasley, then Weasley."
"I like *really good* Quidditch players," Ron corrected her, still smiling. "Well, see you... Got to go and get ready for the party..."
She left. At once Ron and Ron put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about Weasley, and all they had ever guessed about Ron. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Ron was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.
When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o'clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Ron. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Ron was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs.
"Hi," he said. "Shall we get going then?"
"Oh yes," she said happily. "Where is the party?"
"Weasley's office," said Ron, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. "Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming?"
"Ron Weasley?" asked Ron.
"I - what?" said Ron, disconcerted. "You mean the Minister of Magic?"
"Yes, he's a vampire," said Ron matter-of-factly. "Ronher wrote a very long article about it when Weasley first took over from Ron Weasley, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out!"
Ron, who thought it most unlikely that Ron Weasley was a vampire, but who was used to Ron repeating her father's bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Weasley's office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took.
Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Weasley's office was much larger than the usual teacher's study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.
"Ron, m'boy!" boomed Weasley, almost as soon as Ron and Ron had squeezed in through the door. "Come in, come in, so many people I'd like you to meet!"
Weasley was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Ron's arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Weasley led him purposefully into the party; Ron seized Ron's hand and dragged her along with him.
"Ron, I'd like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of ' Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampires' - and, of course, his friend Sanguini."
Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Ron's hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited.
"Ron Weasley, I am simply delighted!" said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Ron's face. "I was saying to Professor Weasley only the other day, 'Where is the biography of Ron Weasley for which we have all been waiting?'"
"Er," said Ron, "were you?"
"Just as modest as Ron described!" said Worple. "But seri-ously" -- his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike -- "I would be delighted to write it myself-- people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in
four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you -- ask Sanguini here if it isn't quite -- Sanguini, stay here!" added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. "Here, have a pasty," said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini's hand before turning his attention back to Ron. "My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea --"
"I'm definitely not interested," said Ron firmly, "and I've just seen a friend of mine, sorry." He pulled Ron after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters.
"Ron! Ron !"
"Ron! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Ron !"
"What's happened to you?" asked Ron, for Ron looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil's Snare.
"Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, I've just left Ron," she said. "Under the mistletoe," she added in explanation, as Ron continued to look questioningly at her.
"Serves you right for coming with him," he told her severely. "I thought he'd annoy Ron most," said Ron dispassion-ately. "I debated for a while about Ron Weasley, but I thought, on the whole --"
"You considered Weasley?" said Ron, revoked.
"Yes, I did, and I'm starting to wish I'd chosen him, Weasley makes Ron look a gentleman. Let's go this way, we'll be able to see him coming, he's so tall. . . ." The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Weasley was standing there alone.
"Hello," said Ron politely to Professor Weasley.
"Good evening, my dear," said Professor Weasley, focusing upon Ron with some difficulty. Ron could smell cooking sherry again. "I haven't seen you in my classes lately. .."
"No, I've got Ron this year," said Ron.
"Oh, of course," said Professor Weasley with an angry, drunken titter. "Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Weasley might have got rid of the horse? But no ... we share classes. . . . It's an insult, frankly, an
insult. Do you know. . ." Professor Weasley seemed too tipsy to have recognized Ron.
Under cover of her furious criticisms of Ron, Ron drew closer to Ron and said, "Let ' s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?"
Ron raised her eyebrows. "Do you really think I'd stoop that low?"
Ron looked at her shrewdly. "Ron, if you can ask 0111 Weasley --"
"There's a difference," said Ron with dignity. "I've got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts."
"Good," said Ron fervently. "Because he'll just fall apart again, and we'll lose the next match --"
"Quidditch!" said Ron angrily. "Is that all boys care about? Ron hasn't asked me one single question about myself, no, I've just been treated to 'A Hundred Great Saves Made by Ron Weasley' nonstop ever since -- oh no, here he comes!" She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished.
"Seen Ron?" asked Weasley, forcing his way through the throng a minute later.
"No, sorry," said Ron, and he turned quickly to join in Ron's conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.
"Ron Weasley!" said Professor Weasley in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time.
"Oh, hello," said Ron unenthusiastically.
"My dear boy!" she said in a very carrying whisper. "The rumors! The stories! 'The Ronsen One'! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Ron. . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!"
"Ah, Sybi l l, we all think our subject's most important!" said a loud voice, and Weasley appeared at Professor Weasley s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. "But I don't t hink I've ever known such a natural at Potions!" said Weasley, re-garding Ron with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. "Instinctive, you know -- like his mother! I've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l -- why even Ron --" And to Ron's horror, Weasley threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Weasley out of thin air toward them. "Stop skulking and come and
join us, Ron!" hiccuped Weasley happily. "I was just talking about Ron's exceptional po-tion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!"
Trapped, with Weasleys arm around his shoulders, Weasley looked down his hooked nose at Ron, his black eyes narrowed. "Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Weasley anything at all."
"Well, then, it's natural ability!" shouted Weasley. "You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death -- never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don't think even you, Ron --"
"Really?" said Weasley quietly, his eyes still boring into Ron, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Weasley to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.
"Remind me what other subjects you're taking, Ron?" asked Weasley .
"Defense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration , Herbology..."
"All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror ," said Snap e with the faintest sneer.
"Yeah, well, that's what I'd like to do," said Ron defiantly.
"And a great one you'll make too!" boomed Weasley.
"I don't think you should be an Auror, Ron," said Ron unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. "The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease."
Ron inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to lau gh. Really, it had been worth bringing Ron just for this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Ron Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Ron Weasley.
"Professor Weasley," wheezed Weasley, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, "I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?"
Weasley pulled himself free of Weasleys grip, looking furious. "All right, I wasn't invited!" he said angrily. "I was trying to gate crash, happy?"
"No, I'm not!" said Weasley, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. "You're in trouble, you are! Didn't the headma ster say that nighttime prowling ' s out, unless you've got permission, didn't he, eh?"
"That's all right, Ron, that's all right," said Weasley, waving it 1.1 nd. "It's Christmas, and it's not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once, we'll forget any punishment; you may stay , Ron.
Fil ich's expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able; but why, Ron wondered, watching him, did Weasley look almost equally unhappy? And why was Weasley looking at Mal-foy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible? ... a lit tl afraid? But almost before Ron had registered what he had seen, Weasley had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Weasley h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Weasley for his generosity, and Weasley's face was smoothly inscrutable again.
"It's nothing, nothing," said Weasley, waving away Weasley's t hanks. "I did know your grandfather, after all...."
"He always spoke very highly of you, sir," said Weasley quickly. "Said you were the best potion-maker he'd ever known. ..."
Ron stared at Weasley. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Weasley do that to Weasley for a long time. It was the fact that Weasley did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Weasley close up for ages; he now saw that Weasley had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.
"I'd like a word with you, Ron," said Weasley suddenly.
"Now , Ron," said Weasley, hiccuping again, "it's Christ mas, do n't be too hard --"
"I am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or other-wise, to be," said Weasley curtly. "Follow me, Ron."
They left, Weasley leading the way, Weasley looking resentful. Ron stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, "I'll be back in a bit, Ron -- er -- bathroom."
"All right," she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Weasley, who seemed sincerely in terested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Weasley and Weasley. Ron ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Weasley's office behind him. Perhaps Weasley had taken Weasley to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room. . . . Ron pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.
" . . . cannot afford mistakes, Ron, because if you are expelled --"
"I didn't have anything to do with it, all right?"
"I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy a nd foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it."
"Who suspects me?" said Weasley angrily. "For the last time, I didn't do it, okay? That Weasley girl must ' ve had an enemy no on e knows about -- don't look at me like that! I know what you're do-ing, I'm not stupid, but it won't work -- I can stop you!"
There was a pause and then Weasley said quietly, "Ah . . . Aunt Weasleyatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Ron?"
"I'm not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don't want you butting in !" Ron pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Weasley speak to Weasley like this -- Weasley, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?
"So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Ron --"
"So put me in detention! Report me to Weasley!" jeered Weasley.
There was another pause. Then Weasley said, "You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things ."
"You'd better stop telling me to come to your office then!"
"Listen to me," said Weasley, his voice so low now that Ron had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. "I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Ron --"
"Looks like you'll have to break it, then, because I don't need your protection! It's my job, he gave it to me and I'm doing it, I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!"
"What is your plan ?"
"It's none of your business !"
" If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you ..."
"I have all the assistance I need, thanks, I'm not alone!"
"You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the ex-treme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes --"
"I would've had Weasley and Weasley with me if you hadn't put them in detention!"
"Keep your voice down!" spat Weasley, for Weasley ' s voice had risen excitedly. "If your friends Weasley and Weasley intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres --"
"What does it matter?" said Weasley. "Defense Against the Dark Arts -- its all just a joke, isn't it, an act? Like any of us need pro-tecting against the Dark Arts --"
"It is an act that is crucial to success, Ron!" said Weasley. "Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Weasley and Weasley --"
"They're not the only ones, I've got other people on my side, better people!"
"Then why not confide in me, and I can --"
"I know what you're up to! You want to steal my glory!"
There was another pause, then Weasley said coldly, "You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but --"
Ron had barely a second ' s warning; he heard Weasley's footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Weasley was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Weasleys office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Ron remained crouched down as Weasley emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfath-omable, he returned to the party. Ron remained on the floor, hid-den beneath the cloak, his mind racing.
Chapter 16: AVeryFrosty Christmas
"So Weasley was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?"
"If you ask. that once more," said Ron, "I'm going to stick this sprout --"
"I'm only checking!" said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow's kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.
"Yes, Weasley was offering to help him!" said Ron. "He said he'd promised Weasley's mother to protect him, that he'd made an Un-breakable Oath or something --"
"An Unbreakable Vow?" said Ron, looking stunned. "Nah, he can't have. . . . Are you sure?"
"Yes, I'm sure," said Ron. "Why, what does it mean?"
"Well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. . . ."
"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?"
"You die," said Ron simply. "Ron and Ron tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Ron and everything when Dad found us. He went mental," said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. "Only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Ron reckons his left but-tock has never been the same since."
"Yeah, well, passing over Ron's left buttock --"
"I beg your pardon?" said Ron's voice as the twins entered the kitchen.
"Aaah, Ron, look at this. They're using knives and everything. Bless them."
"I'll be seventeen in two and a bit months' time," said Ron grumpily, "and then I'll be able to do it by magic!"
"But meanwhile," said Ron, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, "we can enjoy watching you demon-strate the correct use of a -- whoops-a-daisy!"
"You made me do that!" said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. "You wait, when I'm seventeen --"
"I'm sure you'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills," yawned Ron.
"And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald," said Ron, "what is this we hear from Ron about you and a young lady called -- unless our information is faulty -- Ron Weasley?"
Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. "Mind your own business."
"What a snappy retort," said Ron. "I really don't know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was... how did it happen?"
"What d'you mean?"
"Did she have an accident or something?"
"What?" ..¦;
"Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Care-ful, now!"
Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Ron, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand,
"Ron!" she said furiously. "Don't you ever let me see you throw-ing knives again!"
"I wont," said Ron, "let you see," he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.
"Ron, Ron, I'm sorry, dears, but Ron is arriving tonight, so Ron will have to squeeze in with you two." ;
"No problem," said Ron.
- "Then, as Ron isn't coming home, that just leaves Ron and ;¦/ Ron in the attic, and if Ron shares with Ron --" "-- that'll make Ron's Christmas --" muttered Ron. "-- everyone should be comfortable. Well, they'll have a bed, anyway," said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.
"Ron definitely not showing his ugly face, then?" asked Ron. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. "No, he's busy, I expect, at the Ministry."
"Or he's the world's biggest prat," said Ron, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. "One of the two. "Well, let's get going, then, Ron."
"What are you two up to?" asked Ron. "Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we'll be free
too!"
"No, I don't think we can do that," said Ron seriously. "It's very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs --" "-- and if you want people to help you, Ron," added Ron, throwing the paper airplane at him, "I wouldn't chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We're off to the village, there's a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are some-thing marvelous . . , almost like real magic. ..."
"Gits," said Ron darkly, watching Ron and Ron setting off across the snowy yard. "Would've only taken them ten seconds and then we could've gone too."
"I couldn't," said Ron. "I promised Weasley I wouldn't wander off while I'm staying here."
"Oh yeah," said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, "Are you going to tell Weasley what you heard Weasley and Weasley saying to each other?"
"Yep," said Ron. "I'm going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Weasley’s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too."
"Pity you didn't hear what Weasley’s actually doing, though." "I couldn't have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Weasley."
There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, " 'Course, you know what they'll all say? Dad and Weasley and all of them? They'll say Weasley isn't really trying to help Weasley, he was just trying to find out what Weasley's up to."
"They didn't hear him," said Ron flatly. "No one's that good an actor, not even Weasley."
"Yeah . . . I'm just saying, though/' said Ron.
Ron turned to face him, frowning. "You think I'm right, though?" ,
"Yeah, I do!" said Ron hastily. "Seriously, I do! But they're all convinced Weasley's in the Order, aren't they?"
Ron said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Ron now: Obviously, Ron, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Weasley into telling him what he's doing. . . .
This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-nity to tell Ron what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Weasley's
party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate Weasley, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Ron had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time.
Still, even Ron would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-foy was definitely up to something, and Weasley knew it, so Ron felt fully justified in saying "I told you so," which he had done sev-eral times to Ron already.
Ron did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ron had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Ron, Ron, Ron, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Ron on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Ron had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.
They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Ron, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept
pointing her wand at the volume con-trol, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a par-ticularly jazzy number called "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love," Ron and Ron started a game of Exploding Snap with Ron. Ron kept shooting Ron and Ron covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Ron Weasley, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice.
Oh, come and stir my cauldron,
And if you do it right,
I'll boil you up some hot strong love
To keep you warm tonight.
"We danced to this when we were eighteen!" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. "Do you remember, Ron?"
"Mphf?" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. "Oh yes ... marvelous tune . . ."
With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Ron, who was sitting next to him.
"Sorry about this," he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. "Be over soon."
"No problem," said Ron, grinning. "Has it been busy at the Ministry?"
"Very," said Mr. Weasley. "I wouldn't mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we've made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater -- only don't repeat that, Ron," he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.
"They're not still holding Ron Weasley, are they?" asked Ron.
"I'm afraid so," said Mr. Weasley. "I know Weasley's tried appealing directly to Weasley about Ron. ... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and 'three arrests' sounds better than 'three mistaken arrests and releases'. . . but again, this is
all top secret. . . ."
"I won't say anything," said Ron. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called "You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me."
"Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?"
"I checked, Ron," said Mr. Weasley at once. "I went and searched the Weasleys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there."
"Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more ..."
And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between
Weasley and Weasley, As Ron spoke, he saw Weasley's head turn a lit-tle toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina's crooning.
Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? It's left me for a spell...
"Has it occurred to you, Ron," said Mr. Weasley, "that Weasley was simply pretending -- ?"
"Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Weasley's up to?" said Ron quickly. "Yeah, I thought you'd say that. But how do we know?"
"It isn't our business to know," said Weasley unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Ron across Mr. Weasley. "It's Weasley’s business. Weasley trusts Ron, and that ought to be good enough for all of us."
"But," said Ron, "just say -- just say Weasleys wrong about Weasley --"
"People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Weasley’s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Ron."
"But Weasley can make mistakes," argued Ron. "He says it himself. And you" -- he looked Weasley straight in the eye -- "do you honestly like Weasley?"
"I neither like nor dislike Ron," said Weasley. "No, Ron, I am speaking the truth," he added, as Ron pulled a skeptical expres-sion. "We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that hap-pened between Ron and Ron and Ron, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Ron made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-ally do at the full moon."
"But he 'accidentally' let it slip that you're a werewolf, so you had to leave!" said Ron angrily.
Weasley shrugged. "The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful."
"Maybe he didn't dare mess with the potion with Weasley watching him!" said Ron.
"You are determined to hate him, Ron," said Weasley with a faint smile. "And I understand; with Ron as your father, with Sir-ius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Weasley what you have told Ron and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Weasley's orders that Ron questioned Ron." ;
. . . and now you've torn it quite apart I'll thank you to give back my heart!
Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.
"Eez eet over?" said Ron loudly. "Thank goodness, what an 'orrible --"
"Shall we have a nightcap, then?" asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. "Who wants eggnog?"
"What have you been up to lately?" Ron asked Weasley, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.
"Oh, I've been underground," said Weasley. "Almost literally. That's why I haven't been able to write, Ron; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway." -:
"What do you mean?" '
"I've been living among my fellows, my equals," said Weasley. "Werewolves," he added, at Rons look of incomprehension. "Nearly all of them are on Weasley's side. Weasley wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made."
He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, "I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing -- and sometimes killing -- to eat."
"How come they like Weasley?"
"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life," said Weasley. "And it is hard to argue with Weasley out there. . . ."
"Who's Weasley?"
"You haven't heard of him?" Weasley's hands closed convulsively in his lap. "Ron Weasley is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-wolves to overcome the wizards. Weasley has promised him prey in return for his services. Weasley specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away
from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Weasley has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results."
Weasley paused and then said, "It was Weasley who bit me." "What?" said Ron, astonished. "When -- when you were a kid, you mean?"
"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-ing by then how it felt to transform. But Weasley is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Weasley is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Weasley's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people." "But you are normal!" said Ron fiercely. "You've just got a -- a
problem --"
Weasley burst out laughing. "Sometimes you remind me a lot of Ron. He called it my 'furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved
rabbit."
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Ron, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Weasley.
"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?"
"The Half-Blood what?"
"Prince," said Ron, watching him closely for signs of recogni-tion.
"There are no Wizarding princes," said Weasley, now smiling. "Is this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-ing 'the Ronsen One' would be enough."
"It's nothing to do with me!" said Ron indignantly. "The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus --"
"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts," said Weasley reminiscently. "There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle."
"My dad used it," said Ron. "I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Weasley."
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-ment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Weasleys smile was a little too understanding.
"Yes," he said, "but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . ."
"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school," Ron persisted.
"Not necessarily," said Weasley. "Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else."
He looked into Ron's face and then said quietly, "Ron was a pureblood, Ron, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him 'Prince.'"
Abandoning pretense, Ron said, "And it wasn't Ron? Or you?"
"Definitely not."
"Oh." Ron stared into the fire. "I just thought -- well, he's helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has."
"How old is this book, Ron?"
"I dunno, I've never checked."
"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts," said Weasley.
Shortly after this, Ron decided to imitate Celestina singing "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love," which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Ron and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron's attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Ron.
Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Ron delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-lished. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father's friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Ron threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Weasley, Ron Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .
"She's got to be joking. . . ."
Ron woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what ap-peared to be a thick gold chain.
"What's chat?" asked Ron. '
"Its from Ron," said Ron, sounding revolted^ "She earn
honestly think I'd wear ..."
Ron looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan
gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:
"My sweetheart"
"Nice," he said. "Classy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Ron and Ron."
"If you tell them," said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, "I -- I -- I’ll --"
"Stutter at me?" said Ron, grinning. "Come on, would I?"
"How could she think I'd like something like that, though?" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.
"Well, think back," said Ron. "Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck?"
"Well... we don't really talk much," said Ron. "It's mainly . . ."
"Snogging," said Ron.
"Well, yeah," said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, "Is Ron really going out with Weasley?"
"I dunno," said Ron. "They were at Weasley's party together, but I don't think it went that well."
Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.
Rons presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Ron,
Ron stared at it. "D'you reckon this is safe to open?" he asked. "Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry," replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.
"I didn't think of giving Ron anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?" asked Ron, prodding the parcel cautiously.
"Ron would," said Ron. "But let's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty."
A moment later, Ron had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. "Nice," said Ron, roaring with laughter. "Very thoughtful." "I'd rather have them than that necklace," said Ron, which sobered Ron up at once.
Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Ron (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch's hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-tacular golden necklace.
"Ron and Ron gave them to me! Aren't they beautiful?" .: "Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we're washing our own socks," said Ron, waving an airy hand. "Parsnips, Ron?"
"Ron, you've got a maggot in your hair," said Ron cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Ron felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.
"'Ow 'orrible," said Ron, with an affected little shudder.
"Yes, isn't it?" said Ron. "Gravy, Ron?"
. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Ron waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.
"You are as bad as zat Weasley," said Ron to Ron, when she had finished kissing Ron in thanks. "She is always knocking --"
"I invited dear Weasley to come along today," said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Ron. "But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Ron?"
"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much," said Weasley. "But Weasley has got her own family to go to, hasn't she?"
"Hmmm," said Mrs. Weasley. "Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually."
She gave Weasley an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Ron for a daughter-in-law instead of Weasley, but Ron, glancing across at Ron, who was now feeding Ron bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Weasley, and who better to ask than Weasley, the man who knew all about Patronuses?
"Weasley's Patronus has changed its form," he told him. "Weasley said so anyway. I didn't know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?"
Weasley took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, "Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional up-heaval ..."
"It looked big, and it had four legs," said Ron, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his voice. "Hey ... it couldn't be -- ?"
"Ron!" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. "Ron -- it's Ron!"
"What?"
Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ron stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Ron Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.
"Ron, he's -- he's with the Minister!"
And sure enough, the man Ron had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Ron's wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Ron.
There was a moment's painful silence. Then Ron said rather stiffly, "Merry Christmas, Mother."
"Oh, Ron!" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.
Ron Weasley paused in the doorway, leaning on his walk-ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.
"You must forgive this intrusion," he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. "Ron and I were in the vicinity -- working, you know -- and he couldn't re-sist dropping in and seeing you all."
But Ron showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr. Weasley, Ron, and Ron were all observing him, stony-faced.
"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. ... 1 '. mean --"
"No, no, my dear Ron," said Weasley. Ron guessed that he had checked her name with Ron before they entered the house. "I don't want to intrude, wouldn't be here at all if Ron hadn't wanted to see you all so badly. . . ."
"Oh, Perce!" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.
". , . We've only looked in for five minutes, so I'll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Ron. No, no, I assure you I don't want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man's finished, why doesn't he take a stroll with me?"
The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Every-body looked from Weasley to Ron. Nobody seemed to find Weasley's pretense that he did not know Ron's name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ron, Ron, and Ron also had clean plates.
"Yeah, all right," said Ron into the silence.
He was not fooled; for all Weasley's talk that they had just been in the area, that Ron wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Weasley could speak to Ron alone.
"It's fine," he said quietly, as he passed Weasley, who had half risen from his chair. "Fine," he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.
"Wonderful!" said Weasley, standing back to let Ron pass
through the door ahead of him. "We'll just take a turn around the garden, and Ron and I'll be off. Carry on, everyone!"
Ron walked across the yard toward the Weasleys' overgrown, snow-covered garden, Weasley limping slightly at his side. He had, Ron knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Weasley in his bowler hat.
"Charming," said Weasley, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. "Charming."
Ron said nothing. He could tell that Weasley was watching him.
"I've wanted to meet you for a very long time," said Weasley, after a few moments. "Did you know that?"
"No," said Ron truthfully. ¦!.
"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Weasley has been very protective of you," said Weasley. "Natural, of course, natural, after what you've been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry ...":
He waited for Ron to say something, but Ron did not oblige, : so he went on, "I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Weasley has -- most under-standably, as I say -- prevented this."
Still, Ron said nothing, waiting.
"The rumors that have flown around!" said Weasley. "Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being 'the Ronsen One'. . ."
They were getting near it now, Ron thought, the reason Scrim-geour was here.
"I assume that Weasley has discussed these matters with you?",
Ron deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Ron had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it.
"Yeah, we've discussed it."
"Have you, have you . . ." said Weasley. Ron could see, out of the corner of his eye, Weasley squinting at him, so he pre-tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. "And what has Weasley told you, Ron?"
"Sorry, but that's between us," said Ron. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Weasley's tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, "Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you to divulge . . . no, no ... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are 'the Ronsen One' or not?"
Ron had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. "I don't really know what you mean, Minister."
"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously," said Scrim-geour with a laugh. "But to the Wizarding community at large . . . it's all perception, isn't it? It's what people believe that's important."
Ron said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Weasley get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Ron kept his eyes fixed upon it.
"People believe you are 'the Ronsen One,' you see," said Scrim-geour. "They think you quite the hero -- which, of course, you arc, Ron, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway," he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, "the point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Ron. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -- well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can't help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost."
The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Ron was silent so
long that Weasley said, looking from Ron to the gnome, "Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Ron?"
"I don't exactly understand what you want," said Ron slowly. '"Rond alongside the Ministry' . . . What does that mean?"
"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you," said Scrim-geour. "If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impres-sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Ron Weasley has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. ..."
Ron felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Ron Weasley was still at the Ministry, was she?
"So basically," he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, "you'd like to give the impression that I'm working for the Ministry?"
"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Ron," said Weasley, sounding relieved that Ron had cot-toned on so quickly. "'The Ronsen One,' you know. . . It's all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are hap-pening. ..."
"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry," said Ron, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, "won't that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry's up to?"
"Well," said Weasley, frowning slightly, "well, yes, that's partly why we'd like --"
"No, I don't think that'll work," said Ron pleasantly. "You see, I don't like some of the things the Ministry's doing. Locking up Ron Weasley, for instance."
Weasley did not speak for a moment but his expression hard-ened instantly. "I would not expect you to understand," he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Ron had been. "These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old --"
"Weasley's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Ron should be in Azkaban either," said Ron. "You're making Ron a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot."
They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Weasley said, with no pretense at warmth, "I see. You prefer -- like your hero, Weasley -- to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?" "I don't want to be used," said Ron.
"Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry!" "Yeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison," said Ron, his temper rising now. "You're doing what Ron Weasley
did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Weasley, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Ronsen One' work-ing for you!" ' i
"So you're not 'the Ronsen One'?" said Weasley. '
"I thought you said it didn't matter either way?" said Ron, with a bitter laugh. "Not to you anyway."
"I shouldn't have said that," said Weasley quickly. "It was tactless --"
"No, it was honest," said Ron. "One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Weasley. I haven't forgotten, Minister...."
He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Ron Weasley had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.
"I don't remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Weasley was back. The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year."
They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.
"What is Weasley up to?" said Weasley brusquely. "Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?"
"No idea," said Ron.
"And you wouldn't tell me if you knew," said Weasley, "would you?"
"No, 1 wouldn't," said Ron.
"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can't find out by other means."
"You can try," said Ron indifferently. "But you seem cleverer than Weasley, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mis-takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Weasley’s still headmaster. I'd leave Weasley alone, if I were you."
There was a long pause.
"Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you," said Weasley, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, "Weasley’s man through and through, aren't you, Weasley?"
"Yeah, I am," said Ron. "Glad we straightened that out."
And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house.
Chapter 17: A Sluggish Memory
Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Ron, Ron, and Ron lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Ron, Ron, Ron, and Ron were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Ron had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Ron, Ron, and Ron all claimed credit).
"Don't cry, Mum," said Ron, patting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. "It's okay. ..."
"Yeah, don't worry about us," said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, "or about Ron. He's such a prat, it's not really a loss, is it?"
Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Ron in her arms.
"Promise me you'll look after yourself.. .. Stay out of trouble. ..."
"I always do, Mrs. Weasley," said Ron. "I like a quiet life, you know me."
She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. "Be good, then, all of you. ..."
Ron stepped into the emerald fire and shouted "Hogwarts!" He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys' kitchen and Mrs. Weasley's tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor Weasley's office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate.
"Evening, Weasley. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet."
"No, Professor."
Ron straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When Ron had arrived, all three of them trooped out of Weasley's office and off toward Weasley Tower. Ron glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Weasley feeding Ron in front of his cabin.
"Baubles," said Ron confidently, when they reached the Ron Weasley, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice.
"No," she said.
"What d’you mean, ‘no’ ?
"There is a new password," she said. "And please don't shout."
"But we've been away, how're we supposed to -- ?"
"Ron! Ron!"
Ron was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves.
"I got back a couple of hours ago, I've just been down to visit Weasley and Buck -- I mean Witherwings," she said breathlessly. "Did you have a good Christmas?"
"Yeah," said Ron at once, "pretty eventful, Ron Scrim --" ] "I've got something for you, Ron," said Ron, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. "Oh, hang on -- password. Abstinence."
"Precisely," said the Ron Weasley in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole.
"What's up with her?" asked Ron.
"Overindulged over Christmas, apparently," said Ron, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. "She and her friend
Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anyway..."
She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Weasley's writing on it.
"Great," said Ron, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Weasley was scheduled for the following night. "I’ve got loads to tell him -- and you. Let's sit down --"
But at that moment there was a loud squeal of "Won-Won!" and Ron Weasley came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron's arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Ron gave a tinkling laugh and said, "There's a cable over here... Coming. Ron?"
"No, thanks, I said I'd meet Ron," said Ron, though Ron could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Ron locked in a kind of vertical wrestling, match, Ron led Ron over to the spare table.
"So how was your Christmas?"
"Oh, fine," she shrugged. "Nothing special. How was it at Won-Won's?"
"I'll tell you in a minute," said Ron. "Look, Ron, can't you --"
"No, I can't," she said flatly. "So don't even ask."
"I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas --"
"It was the Ron Weasley who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine, Ron, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me?"
She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Ron dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Weasley and Weasley. When he had finished, Ron sat in thought for a moment and then said, "Don't you think -- ?"
"-- he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Weasley into telling him what he's doing?"
"Well, yes," said Ron.
"Ron’s dad and Weasley think so," Ron said grudgingly. "But this definitely proves Weasley’s planning something, you can't deny that."
"No, I can't," she answered slowly.
"And he's acting on Weasley's orders, just like I said!"
"Hmm .. . did either of them actually mention Weasley's name?"
Ron frowned, trying to remember. "I'm not sure ... Weasley definitely said 'your master,' and who else would that be?"
"I don't know," said Ron, biting her lip. "Maybe his father?"
She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Ron tickling Ron. "How's Weasley?"
"Not great," said Ron, and he told her all about Weasley’s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. "Have you heard of this Ron Weasley?"
"Yes, I have!" said Ron, sounding startled. "And so have you, Ron!"
"When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened ..."
"No, no, not History of Magic -- Weasley threatened Borgin with Kim!" said Ron. "Back in Knockturn Alley, don't you remember? He told Borgin that Weasley was an old family friend and that he'd be checking up on Borgin's progress!"
Ron gaped at her. "I forgot! But this proves Weasley s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Weasley and telling him what to do?"
"It is pretty suspicious," breathed Ron. "Unless . . ." "Oh, come on," said Ron in exasperation, "you can't get round this one!"
"Well . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat." "You're unbelievable, you are," said Ron, shaking his head.
"We'll see who's right. . . . You'll be eating your words, Ron, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, 1 had a row with Ron Weasley as well. . . ."
And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Ron, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Ron through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.
The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.
APPARITION LESSONS
If you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor. Please sign below if you would like to participate. Cost: 12 Galleons.
Ron and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom. Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Ron when Ron crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, "Guess who, Won-Won?" Ron turned to see Ron stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Ron, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Ron sped up to walk with Ron.
"So -- Apparition," said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Ron was not to mention what had just happened. "Should be a laugh, eh?"
"I dunno," said Ron. "Maybe it's better when you do it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Weasley took me along for the ride."
"I forgot you'd already done it. ... I'd better pass my test first
time," said Ron, looking anxious. "Ron and Ron did," "Ron failed, though, didn't he?" "Yeah, but Ron's bigger than me" -- Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla -- "so Ron and Ron
didn't go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . ." "When can we take the actual test?" "Soon as we're seventeen. That's only March for me!" "Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle . . ."
"Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted."
Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming , lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will.
"How cool will it be when we can just --" Ron clicked his ringers to indicate disappearance. "Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I can do it back. . . He'll never have another peaceful moment. . . ."
Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today's Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Weasley flat on his face.
"Ron’s already Apparated," Ron told a slightly abashed Ron, after Professor Weasley had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Ron lines: "I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick." "Dum -- er -- someone took him. Side-Along-Apparition, you know."
"Whoa!" whispered Ron, and he, Ron, and Ron put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Ron was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with Weasley.
The lamps in Weasley’s office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pen-sieve was ready upon the desk once more. Weasley’s hands lay on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Ron wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Weasley had said that he would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to discuss. But before Ron could say anything about Weasley and Weasley, Weasley spoke.
"I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?" "Yes," said Ron. "He's not very happy with me."
"No," sighed Weasley. "He is not very happy with me either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Ron, but battle on."
Ron grinned.
"He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry's doing a wonderful job.'
Weasley smiled.
"It was Weasley's idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your
support --"
"After everything Weasley did last year?" said Ron angrily. "After Weasley ?"
"I told Ron there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left: office. Within hours of Weasley's appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you --"
"So that's why you argued!" Ron blurted out. "It was in the Daily Prophet"'
"The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally," said Weasley, "if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Ron found a way to corner you at last."
"He accused me of being 'Weasley's man through and through.'"
"How very rude of him."
"I told him I was."
Weasley opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Ron, Ron the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Ron’s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized
that Weasley's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, ami stared hastily at his own knees. When Weasley spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.
"I am very touched, Ron."
"Weasley wanted to know where you go when you're not at Hogwarts," said Ron, still looking fixedly at his knees.
"Yes, he is very nosy about that," said Weasley, now sounding cheerful, and Ron thought it safe to look up again. "He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Weasley to tail me. It wasn't kind. I have already been forced to jinx Weasley once; I did it again with the greatest regret."
"So they still don't know where you go?" asked Ron, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Weasley merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.
"No, they don't, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there's anything else -- ?" "There is, actually, sir," said Ron. "It's about Weasley and Weasley."
"Professor Weasley, Ron."
"Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Weasleys party . . . well, I followed them, actually. ..."
Weasley listened to Ron's story with an impassive face. When Ron had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, "Thank you for telling me this, Ron, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance."
"Not of great importance?" repeated Ron incredulously. "Professor, did you understand -- ?"
"Yes, Ron, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me," said Weasley, a little sharply. "I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have con-lided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet."
Ron sat in seething silence, glaring at Weasley. What was going on? Did this mean that Weasley had indeed ordered Weasley to find out what Weasley was doing, in which case he had already heard everything Ron had just told him from Weasley? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not to be?
"So, sir," said Ron, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, "you definitely still trust -- ?"
"I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already," said Weasley, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. "My answer has not changed."
"I should think not," said a snide voice; Phineas  was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Weasley ignored him.
"And now, Ron, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening."
Ron sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Weasley? As though he had read Ron's mind, Weasley shook his head.
"Ah, Ron, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!"
"I don't think what you've got to say is unimportant, sir," said Ron stiffly.
"Well, you are quite right, because it is not," said Weasley briskly. "I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, 1 think, the most important I have collected."
Ron did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.
"So," said Weasley, in a ringing voice, "we meet this evening to continue the tale of Ron Weasley, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.
"Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Ron Weasley, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Weasley House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head," continued Weasley, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. "How soon Weasley learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know -- perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance.
"However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Weasleys with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed police, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him."
"Didn't you tell them, sir, what he'd been like when you met him at the orphanage?" asked Ron.
"No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance."
Weasley paused and looked inquiringly at Ron, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Weasley's tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But then Ron remembered something. . . .
"But you didn't really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Weasley who came out of that diary said, 'Weasley never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.'"
"Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy," said Weasley. "I had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Weasley had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues.
"As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Weasley undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group
had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
"Rigidly controlled by Weasley, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Weasley was wrongly accused of that crime.
"I have not been able to find many memories of Weasley at Hogwarts," said Weasley, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. "Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.
"Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Weasley was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Ron Weasley senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his
father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Volde-mort, and began his investigations into his previously despised mother's family -- the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.
"All he had to go upon was the single name 'Ron,' which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother's father's name. Finally, after painstaking research, through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Weasley's surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Weasley relatives. And now, Ron, if you will stand ..." :
Weasley rose, and Ron saw that he was again holding a. small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
"I was very lucky to collect this," he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. "As you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?"
Ron stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.
It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Weasley had landed beside him. The Weasleys' house was now more
indescribably filthy than anywhere Ron had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Ron could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Ron wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But
then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left.
The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Ron recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome -- the teenage Weasley.
Weasley's eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.
"YOU!" he bellowed. "YOU!"
And he hurtled drunkenly at Weasley, wand and knife held aloft.
"Stop."
Weasley spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Weasley. There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The man broke it.
"You speak it?"
"Yes, I speak it," said Weasley. He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Ron could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Weasley's complete lack of fear. His race merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.
"Where is Ron?" he asked.
"Dead," said the other. "Died years ago, didn't he?"
Weasley frowned.
"Who are you, then?"
"I’m Ron, ain't I?"
"Ron's son?"
"'Course I am, then..." • ,, .
Ron pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Weasley, and Ron saw that he wore Ron's black-stoned ring on his right hand.
"I thought you was that Muggle," whispered Ron. "You look mighty like that Muggle."
"What Muggle?" said Weasley sharply.
"That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way," said Ron, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. "You look right like him. Weasley. But he's older now, in 'e? He's older'n you, now I think on it. ..."
Ron looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching the edge of the table for support. "He come back, see," he added stupidly.
Weasley was gazing at Ron as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, "Weasley came back?"
"Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!" said Ron, spitting on the floor again. "Robbed us, mind, before she ran off. , Where's the locket, eh, where's Weasley's locket?"
Weasley did not answer. Ron was working himself into a rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, "Dishonored us, , she did, that little slut! And whore you, coming here and asking questions about all that? It's over, innit. . . . It's over. ..."
He looked away, staggering slightly, and Weasley moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Weasley's lamp and Ron's candle, extinguishing everything. . . . Weasley's fingers closed tightly around Ron's arm and they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light in Weasley's office seemed to dazzle Ron's eyes after that impenetrable darkness.
"Is that all?" said Ron at once. "Why did it go dark, what happened?"
"Because Ron could not remember anything from that point onward," said Weasley, gesturing Ron back into his seat. "When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Ron's ring had gone.
"Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Ron Weasley Senior and his mother and father.
"The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Weasleys died, for the Avadu Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The exception sits before me," Weasley added, with a nod to Ron's scar. "The Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard's murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley from the Weasley house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people.
"So the Ministry called upon Ron. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Weasleys. And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight.
All that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared. 'He'll kill me for losing it,' he told his captors over and over again. 'He'll kill me for losing his ring.' And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Ron's last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls."
"So Weasley stole Ron's wand and used it?" said Ron, sitting up straight.
"That's right," said Weasley. "We have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Weasley Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to 'the big house over the way.' There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Weasley line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Weasley hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle's mind, laid Ron's wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed."
"And Ron never realized he hadn't done it?"
"Never," said Weasley. "He gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession."
"But he had this real memory in him all the time!" "Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him," said Weasley, "and why should anybody delve further into Ron's mind when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Ron in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Weasley's past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Ron's release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Ron had died."
"But how come the Ministry didn't realize that Weasley had done all that to Ron?" Ron asked angrily "He was underage at the time, wasn't he? I thought they could detect underage magic!" "You are quite right -- they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by --"
"Ron," growled Ron; this injustice still rankled. "So if you're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?"
"They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic," said Weasley, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Rons face. "They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls."
"Well, that's rubbish," snapped Ron. "Look what happened here, look what happened to Ron!"
"I agree," said Weasley. "Whatever Ron was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. ..."
Weasley took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Ron fell silent at once, remembering that Weasley had said it was the most important one he had collected. Ron noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?
"This will not take long," said Weasley, when he had finally emptied the phial. "We shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then . . ."
And Ron fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once.
It was a much younger Ron Weasley. Ron was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Weasley with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair
quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Weasley Ron knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple.
Ron looked around as Weasley appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Weasley's office. Haifa dozen boys were sitting around Weasley, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens. Ron recognized Weasley at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Ron saw that he was wearing Ron's gold-and-black ring; he had already killed his father.
"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?" he asked.
"Ron, Ron, if I knew I couldn't tell you," said Weasley, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Weasley, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. "I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are."
Weasley smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.
"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter -- thank you fm the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite -- "
As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that Ron could see nothing but the face of Weasley, who was standing beside him. Then Weasley's voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, "You'll go wrong, boy, mark my words. "
The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Ron looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Weasley's desk chimed eleven o'clock.
"Good gracious, is it that time already?" said Weasley. "You'd better get going, boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Weasley, I want your essay by tomorrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery."
Weasley pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Weasley, however, stayed behind. Ron could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Weasley.
"Look sharp, Ron," said Weasley, turning around and finding him still present. "You don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect..."
"Sir, I wanted to ask you something."
"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away...."
"Sir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?"
And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Ron could not see Weasley or Weasley at all; only Weasley, smiling serenely beside him. Then Weasley's voice boomed out again, just as it had done before.
"I don't know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn't tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you mentioning them again!"
"Well, that's that," said Weasley placidly beside Ron.
"Time to go."
And Ron's feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the
rug in front of Weasley's desk.
"That's all there is?" said Ron blankly.
Weasley had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Weasley had asked a question and failed to get an answer.
"As you might have noticed," said Weasley, reseating himself behind his desk, "that memory has been tampered with."
"Tampered with?" repeated Ron, sitting back down too.
"Certainly," said Weasley. "Professor Weasley has meddled with his own recollections."
"But why would he do that?"
"Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers," said Weasley. "He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.
"And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Ron. It will be your job to persuade Professor Weasley to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all."
Ron stared at him.
"But surely, sir," he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, "you don't need me -- you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ..."
"Professor Weasley is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both," said Weasley. "He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Ron Weasley, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
"No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Weasley by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Ron. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck . . . and good night."
A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Ron got to his feet quickly. "Good night, sir."
As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas  say, "I can't see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Weasley."
"I wouldn't expect you to, Phineas," replied Weasley, and Ron gave another low, musical cry.

Chapter 18: Birthday Surprises
The next day Ron confided in both Ron and Ron the task that Weasley had set him, though separately, for Ron still refused to remain in Ron's presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.
Ron thought that Ron was unlikely to have any trouble with Weasley at all.
'He loves you,' he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. 'Won't refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.'
Ron, however, took a gloomier view.
'He must be determined to hide what really happened if Weasley couldn't get it out of him,' she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. 'Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I've never even heard of them ...'
'You haven't?'
Ron was disappointed; he had hoped that Ron might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.
'They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Weasley have wanted to know about them? I think it's going to be difficult to get the information, Ron, you'll have to be very careful about how you approach Weasley, think out a strategy ..."
'Ron reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon ...'
'Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it,' she said, flaring up at once. 'After all, when has Won-Won's judgement ever been faulty?'
'Ron, can't you --'
'No!' she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Ron alone and ankle-deep in snow.
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Ron, Ron and Ron had to share a desk. Today, Ron moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ron, and ignored both Ron and Ron.
'What've you done?' Ron muttered to Ron, looking at Ron's haughty profile.
But before Ron could answer, Weasley was calling for silence from the front of the room.
'Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott's Third Law ... who can tell me -? But Miss Weasley can, of course!'
Ron recited at top speed: 'Golpalott's-Third-Law- states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to- more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separale- components.'
'Precisely!' beamed Weasley. Ten points for Weasley! Now, if we accept Golpalott's Third Law as true ..."
Ron was going to have to take Weasley's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not under-stood any of it. Nobody apart from Ron seemed to be following what Weasley said next, either.
'... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's ingredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in a
of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements -'
Ron was sitting beside Ron with his mouth half-open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Ron to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.
'... and so,' finished Weasley, 'I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don't forget your protective gloves!'
Ron had left her stool and was halfway towards Siughorn's desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to move, and by the time Ron, Ron and Ron returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.
'it's a shame that the Prince won't be able to help you much with this, Ron,' she said brightly as she straightened up. 'You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!'
Annoyed, Ron uncorked the poison he had taken from Siughorn's desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Ron had done.
'You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?' Ron muttered to Ron.
Ron pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on Antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Ron had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the
Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Ron, had had no difficulty understanding it.
'Nothing,' said Ron gloomily.
Ron was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incan-tations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ron Weasley, however, was muttering, 'Specialis revelio!' over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Ron and Ron hastened to imitate him.
It took Ron only five minutes to realise that his reputa-tion as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Weasley had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had with-drawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Ron's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than any-thing else, Ron bent over the Half-Blood Prince's book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.
And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes.
Just shove a bezoar down their throats.
Ron stared at these words for a moment. Hadn't he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn't Weasley mentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? 'A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.'
It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Weasley still been their teacher, Ron would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word 'Bezoars'.
He opened the box just as Weasley called, Two minutes left, everyone!' Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Ron seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.
'Time's ... UP!' called Weasley genially. 'Well, let's see how you've done! Ron ... what have you got for me?'
Slowly, Weasley moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Ron was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Weasley reached her. Ron had given up com-pletely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Ron stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.
Weasley reached their table last. He sniffed Ron's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.
'And you, Ron,' he said. 'What have you got to show me?'
Ron held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.
Weasley looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Ron wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.
'You've got a nerve, boy!' he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. 'Oh, you're like your mother ... well, 1 can't fault you ... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!'
Ron, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair,
bubbled sluggishly behind Weasley, who had eyes for nobody but Ron.
'And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Ron?' she asked through gritted teeth.
That's the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!' said Weasley happily, before Ron could reply. 'Just like his mother, she had the same
intuitive grasp of potion-making, it's undoubtedly from Ron he gets it ... yes, Ron, yes, if you've got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick ... although as they don't work on everything, and are pretty rare, it's still worth knowing how to mix antidotes ...'
The only person in the room looking angrier than Ron was Weasley, who, Ron was pleased to see, had spilled some-thing that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Ron had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.
Time to pack up!' said Weasley. 'And an extra ten points to Weasley for sheer cheek!'
Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.
Ron dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Ron wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Ron and Weasley were the only two left in the room.
'Come on, now, Ron, you'll be late for your next lesson,' said Weasley affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase.
'Sir,' said Ron, reminding himself irresistibly of Weasley, '1 wanted to ask you something.'
'Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away ..."
'Sir, 1 wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?'
Weasley froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, 'What did you say?' 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -'
'Weasley put you up to this,' whispered Weasley.
His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow.
'Weasley's shown you that - that memory,' said Weasley. 'Well? Hasn't he?'
'Yes,' said Ron, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.
'Yes, of course,' said Weasley quietly, still dabbing at his white face. 'Of course ... well, if you've seen that memory, Ron, you'll know that I don't know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully '- about Horcruxes.'
He seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door.
'Sir,' said Ron desperately, 'I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory -'
'Did you?' said Weasley. Then you were wrong, weren't you? WRONG!'
He bellowed the last word and, before Ron could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him.
Neither Ron nor Ron was at all sympathetic when Ron told them of this disastrous interview Ron was still seething at the way Ron had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Ron hadn't slipped him a bezoar, too.
'It would've just looked stupid if we'd both done it!' said Ron irritably. 'Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Weasley, didn't I? Oh, will you gel a grip!' he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name.
Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Ron's atti-
tudes, Ron brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Weasley. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Weasley think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack.
When Ron did noi question Weasley again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the
matter from his mind. Ron awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac- tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Ron checked with Ron and Ron: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Ron could not help wondering whether this meant that Weasley was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Ron no additional opportunities to question him.
Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Ron for the first lime in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Ron for his trick with the bezoar,
'I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!" she told him. 'Not a single one! I've been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions -nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduciion to Magick Mostc Evilc -- listen -- "of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction" ... 1 mean, why mention it, then?' she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. 'Oh, shut up,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -
'Weasley put you up to this,' whispered Weasley,

The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years' first Apparition lesson, which was sched-uled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds.
When Ron and Ron arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Ron) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors Weasley, Weasley, Weasley and Weasley - the Heads of House - and a small wizard whom Ron took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single
gust of wind might blow him away. Ron wondered whether constant dis-appearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.
'Good morning,' said the Ministry wizard, when all the stu-dents had arrived and the Heads of House had called for quiet. 'My name is Ron Weasley and I shall be your Ministry-Apparition Instructor for the next twelve weeks. 1 hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time -'
'Weasley, be quiet and pay attention!' barked Professor Weasley.
Everybody looked round. Weasley had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Weasley, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argu-ment. Ron glanced quickly at Weasley, who also looked annoyed, though Ron strongly suspected that this was less because of Weasley's rudeness than the fact that Weasley had reprimanded one of his house.
'- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,' Weasley continued, as though there had been no interruption.
'As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.
'I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.'
There was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separ-ated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments.
'Ron, where are you going? 1 demanded Ron.
But Ron did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Weasley was making squeaky attempts to position a few Weasleys, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Weasley, who was chivvying the Weasleys into line, until, by dodging around Ron Weasley, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Weasley, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Weasley, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.
'I don't know how much longer, all right?' Weasley shot at him, oblivious to Ron standing right behind him. 'It's taking longer than I thought it would.'
Weasley opened his mouth, but Weasley appeared to second-guess what he was going to say.
'Look, it's none of your business what I'm doing, Weasley, you and Weasley just do as you're told and keep a lookout!'
'! tell my friends what I'm up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me," Ron said, just loud enough for Weasley to hear him.
Weasley spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at thai precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, 'Quiet!' and silence fell again. Weasley turned slowly to face the front.
Thank you,' said Weasley. :Now then ...'
He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student.
The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!' said Weasley. 'Destination, Determination, Deliberation!
'Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destin-ation,' said Weasley. 'In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.'
Everybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Ron gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn't stop puzzling over what Weasley was doing that needed lookouts.
"Step two,' said Weasley, 'focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!'
Ron glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ron Weasley was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Ron bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.
'Step three,' called Weasley, 'and only when 1 give the com-mand ... lum on the spot, feeiing your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation 1. On my command, now ... one- 1
Ron glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.
Ron tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for.
: - THREE!'
Ron spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Ron was flat on his back; Ron Weasley, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouet-ting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Ron Ron roaring with laughter at him.
'Never mind, never mind,' said Weasley dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. 'Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions ...'
The second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Ron Weasley of Weasley wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.
The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Ron sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified.
'Sph'nching, or the separation of random body parts,' said Ron Weasley dispassionately, 'occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move, without hasie, but with deliberation ... thus.'
Weasley stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. 'Remember the three Ds,' he said, 'and try again ... one -two - three -'
But an hour later, Ron's Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Weasley did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak
at his neck, he merely said, 'Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destin-ation. Determination. Deliberation.'
With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor Weasley. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall.
'How did you do?' asked Ron, hurrying towards Ron. '1 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind of tingling in my feet.'
'1 expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,' said a voice behind them, and Ron stalked past, smirking.
'1 didn't feel anything,' said Ron, ignoring this inter-ruption. "But 1 don't care about that now-'
'What d'you mean, you don't care ... don't you want to leam to Apparate?' said Ron incredulously.
'I'm not fussed, really. I prefer flying,' said Ron, glancing over his shoulder to see where Weasley was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. 'Look, hurry up, will you, there's something I want to do ...'
Perplexed, Ron followed Ron back to Weasley Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Ron, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own
pants, but Ron and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.
'Are you going to tell me what we're doing, then?' asked Ron, panting slightly.
'Up here,' said Ron, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys' staircase.
Their dormitory was, as Ham' had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.
'Ron ...'
'Weasley's using Weasley and Weasley as lookouts. He was argu-ing with Weasley just now. 1 want to know ... aha.'
He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with [he tip of his wand.
'I solemn!)' swear that I am up to no good ... or Weasley is,
At once, the Marauder's Map appeared on the parchment's surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle's floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castle's occupants.
'Help me find Weasley,' said Ron urgently.
He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.
'There!' said Ron, after a minute or so. 'He's in the Weasley common room, look ... with Weasley and Weasley and Weasley and Weasley ..."
Ron looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.
'Well, I'm keeping an eye on him from now on,' he said firmly. 'And the moment 1 see him lurking somewhere with Weasley and Weasley keeping watch outside, it'll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he's-'
He broke off as Ron entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rum-maging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
Despite his determination 10 catch Weasley out, Ron had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Weasley anywhere suspicious. Admit-tedly, he spotted Weasley and Weasley moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Weasley was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Ron toyed with the possibility that Weasley was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high
leve! of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose ihat he was missing Weasley amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Weasley, Weasley and Weasley appeared to be going their dif-ferent ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older - Ron and Ron, Ron reflected sadly, were living proof.
February moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common-room noticeboards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious.
'It was on my birthday!' he said, 'i was looking forward to that!'
'Not a big surprise, though, is it?' said Ron. 'Not after what happened to Ron.'
She had still not returned from Si Mungo's. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.
'But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Appar-ition!' said Ron grumpily. 'Big birthday treat ...'
Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as
ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling towards Ron Weasley and his three Ds, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head.
'Happy birthday, Ron,' said Ron, when they were woken on the first of March by Ron and Ron leaving noisily for breakfast. 'Have a present.'
He threw the package across on to Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Ron assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.
'Cheers,' said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Ron got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rum-maging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.
'Right,' he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap-ping it quietly and murmuring, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' so that Ron, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.
'Nice one, Ron!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Ron had given him.
'No problem,' said Ron absent-mindedly, as he searched the Weasley dormitory closely for Weasley. 'Hey ... I don't think he's in his bed ...'
Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.
'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. 'See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of age next year too ...
'Cool,' muttered Ron, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Weasley? He did not seem to be at the Weasley table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere near Weasley, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ...
'Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Roncolate Cauldrons.
'No thanks,' said Ron, looking up. 'Weasley's gone again!'
'Can't have done,' said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. 'Come on. if you don't hurry up you'll have to Apparate on an empty-stomach ... might make it easier, 1 suppose ..."
Ron looked thoughtfully ai the box of Roncolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third.
Ron tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 'Mischief managed,' though it hadn't been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Weasley's periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Weasley around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon,
'Ready?' he said to Ron.
He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un-focused look on his face.
'Ron? Breakfast.'
'I'm not hungry,'
Ron stared ai him.
'I thought you just said -?'
-Well, all right, I'll come down with you,' sighed Ron, 'but I don't want to eat.'
Ron scrutinised him suspiciously.
'You've just eaten half a box of Roncolate Cauldrons, haven't you?'
'It's not that,' Ron sighed again. 'You ... you wouldn't understand.'
'Fair enough,' said Ron, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.
'Ron!' said Ron suddenly.
'What?'
'Ron, I can't stand it!'
'You can't stand what?' asked Ron, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.
'I can't stop thinking about her!' said Ron hoarsely.
Ron gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Ron 'Lav-Lav', he would have to pui his foot down.
'Why does that stop you having breakfast?' Ron asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.
'I don't think she knows I exist,' said Ron with a desperate gesture.
'She definitely knows you exist,' said Ron, bewildered. 'She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?'
Ron blinked.
'Who are you talking about?'
Who are you talking about?' said Ron, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation.
'Ron Weasley,' said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Ron said, 'This is a joke, right? You're joking.'
T think ... Ron, 1 ihink I love her,' said Ron in a strangled voice.
'OK,' said Ron, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, 'OK ... say that again with a straight face.'
'I love her,' repeated Ron breathlessly. 'Have you seen her hair, it's all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -'
'This is really funny and everything,' said Ron impatiently, 'but joke's over, all right? Drop it.'
He turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron's fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again.
Ron reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\icorpus!
Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him.
'What was that for?' Ron bellowed.
'You insulted her, Ron! You said it was a joke!' shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.
'This is insane!' said Ron. 'What's got into -?'
And then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.
'Where did you get those Roncolate Cauldrons?'
'They were a birthday present!' shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. '1 offered you one, didn't 1?'
'You just picked them up off the floor, didn't you?'
'They'd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!'
'They didn't fall off your bed, you prat, don't you under-stand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. They're the Roncolate Cauldrons Ron gave me before Christmas and they're all spiked with love potion!'
But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.
'Ron?' he repeated. 'Did you say Ron? Ron - do you know her? Can you introduce me?'
Ron stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Ron- thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Ron Weasley.
'Yeah, I'll introduce you,' said Ron, thinking fast. 'I'm going to let you down now, OK?'
He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.
'She'll be in Weasley's office, 1 said Ron confidently, leading the way to the door.
'Why will she be in there?' asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.
'Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,' said Ron, inventing wildly.
'Maybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her?' said Ron eagerly.
'Great idea,' said Ron. Ron was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Ron had not foreseen.
'You're lace, Won-Won!' she pouted. 'I've got you a birth-day-'
'Leave me alone,' said Ron impatiently, 'Ron's going to introduce me to Ron Weasley.'
And without another word to her, he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole. Ron tried to make an apologetic face to Ron, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Ron Weasley swung shut behind them.
Ron had been slightly worried that Weasley might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing-gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.
'Ron,' he mumbled. 'This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ..."
'Professor, I'm really sorry to disturb you,' said Ron as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Weasley into his room, 'but my friend Ron's swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn't make him an antidote, could you? I'd take him to Ron Weasley, but we're not supposed to have anything from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and, you know ... awkward questions ...'
Td have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Ron, an expert potioneer like you?' asked Weasley. 'Er,' said Ron, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, 'well, I've never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right Ron might've done something serious -'
Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, 'I can't see her. Ron - is he hiding her?'
'Was this potion within date?' asked Weasley, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. 'They can strengthen, you know, the longer they're kept.'
That would explain a lot,' panted Ron, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Weasley over. 'It's his birthday, Professor,' he added imploringly.
'Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,' said Weasley, relenting. 'I've got the necessary here in my bag, it's not a difficult antidote ...'
Ron burst through the door into Weasley's overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Ron around the neck and muttered, 'She didn't see that, did she?'
'She's not here yet,' said Ron, watching Weasley opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.
That's good,' said Ron fervently. 'How do I look?'
'Very handsome,' said Weasley smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. 'Now drink that up, it's a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know,'
'Brilliant,' said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.
Ron and Weasley watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and van-ished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.
'Back to normal, then?' said Ron, grinning. Weasley chuckled. Thanks a lot, Professor.'
'Don't mention it, m'boy, don't mention it,' said Weasley, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. 'Pick-me-up, that's what he needs,' Weasley continued, now-bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. 'I've got Butter-beer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead ... hmm ... meant to give that to Weasley for
Christmas ... ah well ...' he shrugged '... he can't miss what he's never had! Why don't we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasley's birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love ...'
He chortled again and Ron joined in. This was the firsi time he had found himself almost alone with Weasley since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Weasley in a good mood ... perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead ...
There you are, then,' said Weasley, handing Ron and Ron a glass of mead each, before raising his own. 'Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph -'
'- Ron -' whispered Ron.
But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.
There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Ron knew there was something terribly wrong and Weasley, it seemed, did not.
'- and may you have many more -
'Ron!'
Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.
'Professor!' Ron bellowed. 'Do something]'
But Weasley seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue.
'What - but -' spluttered Weasley.
Ron leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Weasley's open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron's gargling breath filled the room. Then
he found it - the shrivelled kidney-like stone Weasley had taken from him in Potions.
He hurtled back to Ron's side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still.
Chapter 19: Elf Tails
So, all in all, not one of Ron's better birthdays?" said Ron.
It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit. Ron's was the only occupied bed. Ron, Ron, and Ron were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. Ron Weasley had only let them enter at eight o'clock. Ron and Ron had arrived at ten past.
"This isn't how we imagined handing over our present," said Ron grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron's bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ron.
"Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious," said Ron.
"There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him --" said Ron.
"You were in Hogsmeade?" asked Ron, looking up.
"We were thinking of buying Zonko's," said Ron gloomily. "A Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it'll do us if you lot aren't allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymon ... But never mind that now."
He drew up a chair beside Ron and looked at Ron's pale face.
"How exactly did it happen, Ron?"
Ron retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to Weasley, to Weasley, to Ron Weasley, to Ron, and to Ron.
". . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Weasley ran for help, Weasley and Ron Weasley turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon he'll be all right. Ron Weasley says he'll have to stay here a week or so ... keep taking essence of rue . . ."
"Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar," said Ron in a low voice.
"Lucky there was one in the room," said Ron, who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone.
Ron gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Ron outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened., she had taken almost no part in Ron and Ron's obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until ai last they had been allowed in to see him.
"Do Mum and Dad know?" Ron asked Ron. "They've already seen him, they arrived an hour ago -- they're in Weasley's office now, but they'll be back soon. . . ."
There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep.
"So the poison was in the drink?" said Ron quietly.
"Yes," said Ron at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again. "Weasley poured it out --"
"Would he have been able to slip something into Ron's glass without you seeing?"
"Probably," said Ron, "but why would Weasley want to poison Ron?"
"No idea," said Ron, frowning. "You don't think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?"
"Why would Weasley want to poison Ron?" asked Ron. "I dunno," said Ron, "but there must be loads of people who'd like to poison Ron, mustn't there? 'The Ronsen One' and all that?" "So you think Weasley's a Death Eater?" said Ron. :,
"Anything's possible," said Ron darkly. "He could be under the Imperius Curse," said Ron. "Or he could be innocent," said Ron. "The poison
could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Weasley himself."
"Who'd want to kill Weasley?"
"Weasley reckons Weasley wanted Weasley on his side," said Ron. "Weasley was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And . . ." He thought of the memory Weasley had not yet been able to extract from Weasley. "And maybe Weasley wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Weasley."
"But you said Weasley had been planning to give th.u Untie to Weasley for Christmas," Ron reminded him. "So the poisoner could just as easily have been after Weasley."
"Then the poisoner didn't know Weasley very well," said Ron, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. "Anyone who knew Weasley would have I known there was a good chance he'd keep something that tasty for himself." I
"Er-my-nee," croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them
They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.
The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Weasley came striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind
him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor.
"Bin in the forest all day!" he panted. "Ron's worse, I bin readin' to him -- didn' get up ter dinner till jus' now an' then Professor Weasley told me abou' Ron! How is he?"
"Not bad," said Ron. "They say he'll be okay."
"No more than six visitors at a time!" said Ron Weasley, hurrying out of her office.
"Weasley makes six," Ron pointed out.
"Oh . . . yes. .." said Ron Weasley, who seemed to have been counting Weasley as several people due to his vastness. To cover her confusion, she hurried off to clear up his muddy foot prints with her wand.
"I don' believe this," said Weasley hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron. "Jus' don' believe it... Look at him lyin' there. . . . Who'd want ter hurt him, eh?"
"That's just what we were discussing," said Ron. "We don't know."
"Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryfinndor Quidditch team, could they?" said Weasley anxiously. "Firs' Ron, now Ron . . ."
"I cant see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team," said
I m urge.
Weasley might've done the Weasleys if he could've got away with it," said Ron fairly.
Well, I don't think it's Quidditch, but I think there's a connection between the attacks," said Ron quietly
"How d'you work that out?" asked Ron.
"Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren't, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was (supposed to be killed. Of course," she added broodingly, "that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don't seem to care how many people they finish off In lore they actually reach their victim."
Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, tin- dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Ron and hugged him very tighty. "Weasley's told us how you saved him with the bezoar," she sobbed. "Oh, Ron, what can we say? You saved Ron . . . you saved Ron , . . now you've saved Ron
"Don't be ... I didn't. . ." muttered Ron awkwardly. "Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it," Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. "Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky clay for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Expirv., Ron."
Ron could not think of any reply to this and was almost gl.i«l when Ron Weasley reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ron's bed; he and Ron rose .h once to leave and Weasley decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.
"It's terrible," growled Weasley into his beard, as the three ol them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase. "Ml this new security, an kids are still gettin' hurt. . . . Dumbledoiv's worried sick. . . . He don say much, but I can tell. . . ."
"Hasn't he got any ideas, Weasley?" asked Ron desperately.
"I spect he's got hundreds of ideas, brain like his," said Weasley. "But he doesn' know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they'dve bin caught, wouldn they? Wha' worries me," said Weasley, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Ron, for good measure, checked the ceiling for Ron), "is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein' attacked. Chamber o' Secrets all over again, isn' it? There'll be panic, more parents takin their kids outta school, an nex' thing yeh know the board o' governors ..."
Weasley stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired woman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whisper, ". . . the board o' governors'll be talkin about shuttin' us up fer good."
"Surely not?" said Ron, looking worried.
"Gotta see it from their point o' view," said Weasley heavily. "I mean, it's always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it? Yer expect accidents, don' yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha's tliff'rent. 'S'no wonder Weasley's angry with Sn --"
Weasley stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard.
"What?" said Ron quickly. "Weasley's angry with Weasley?"
"I never said tha’," said Weasley, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. "Look at the time, it's gettin' on fer midnight, I need ter --"
"Weasley, why is Weasley angry with Weasley?" Ron asked loudly.
"Shhhh!" said Weasley, looking both nervous and angry. "Don’ shout stuff like that, Ron, d'yeh wan’ me ter lose me job? Mind, I don' suppose yeh'd care, would yeh, not now yeh've given up Care of Mag--"
"Don't try and make me feel guilty, it wont work!" said Ron forcefully. "What's Weasley done?"
"I dunno, Ron, I shouldn'ta heard it at all! I -- well, I was comin’ outta the forest the other evenin’ an' I overheard 'em talking-- well, arguin’. Didn't like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an tried not ter listen, but it was a -- well, a heated discussion an' it wasn’ easy ter block it out."
"Well?" Ron urged him, as Weasley shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.
"Well -- I jus' heard Weasley sayin’ Weasley took too much fer granted an maybe he -- Weasley -- didn’ wan’ ter do it any more --"
"Do what?"
"I dunno, Ron, it sounded like Weasley was feelin’ a bit overworked, tha's all -- anyway, Weasley told him flat out he'd agreed ter do it an' that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. An' then he said summat abou’ Weasley makin' investigations in his House, in Weasley. Well, there's nothin' strange abou' that!" Weasley added hastily, as Ron and Ron exchanged looks full of meaning. "All the Heads o' Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business --"
"Yeah, but Weasley's not having rows with the rest of them, is he?" said Ron.
"Look," Weasley twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. "I know what yeh're like abou' Weasley, Ron, an' I don' want yeh ter go readin' more inter this than there is."
"Look out," said Ron tersely.
They turned just in time to see the shadow of Ron Weasley looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.
"Oho!" he wheezed. "Out of bed so late, this'll mean detention!"
"No it won', Weasley," said Weasley shortly. "They're with me, aren’ they?"
"And what difference does that make?" asked Weasley obnoxiously.
"I'm a ruddy teacher, aren' I, yeh sneakin' Squib!" said Weasley, firing up at once.
There was a nasty hissing noise as Weasley swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Weasley's skinny ankles.
"Get goin," said Weasley out of the corner of his mouth.
Ron did not need telling twice; he and Ron both hurried off; Weasley's and Weasley's raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Ron near the turning into Weasley Tower, but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,
When there's strife and when there's trouble
Call on Peevsie, he'll make double!
The Ron Weasley was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet; Ron was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Ron bade him good night and set off for the girls' dormitory. Ron, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.
So Weasley had argued with Weasley. In spite of all he had told Ron, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Weasley completely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that Weasley had tried hard enough to investigate the Weasleys ... or, perhaps, to investigate a single Weasley: Weasley?
Was it because Weasley did not want Ron to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Ron's suspicions? That seemed likely. It , might even be that Weasley did not want anything to distract Ron from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Weasley. Perhaps Weasley did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds. ...
"There you are, Weasley!"
Ron jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Ron Weasley.
"I've been waiting for you to come back," said Weasley, disregarding Ron’s drawn wand. "Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn't look like he'll be fit for next week's match."
It took Ron a few moments to realize what Weasley was talking about.
"Oh . . . right. . . Quidditch," he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. "Yeah ... he might not make it."
"Well, then, I'll be playing Keeper, won't I?" said Weasley.
"Yeah," said Ron. "Yeah, I suppose so. ..."
He could not think of an argument against it; after all, Weasley had certainly performed second-best in the trials.
"Excellent," said Weasley in a satisfied voice. "So when's practice?"
"What? Oh . . . there's one tomorrow evening."
"Good. Listen, Weasley, we should have a talk beforehand. I've got some ideas on strategy you might find useful."
"Right," said Ron unenthusiastically. "Well, I'll hear them tomorrow, then. I'm pretty tired now ... see you . . ."
The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Ron's attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions master's room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Weasleys were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Weasley, for many of them wanted to see Ron Weasley, who played Chaser on the Weasley team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Weasley.
Ron, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Ron Weasley. Still checking the Marauder's Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Weasley happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Weasley simply vanished from the map. . . .
But Ron did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Ron Weasley and Ron Weasley.
He could not decide which of them was more annoying. Weasley kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Ron was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Ron with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Ron was forced to remind him who was Captain.
Meanwhile, Ron kept sidling up to Ron to discuss Ron, which Ron found almost more wearing than Weasley's Quidditch lectures. At first, Ron had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing -- "I mean, I am his girlfriend!" -- but unfortunately slit-had now decided to forgive Ron this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him about Ron's feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Ron would have happily forgone.
"Look, why don't you talk to Ron about all this?" Ron asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Ron that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new drew robes to whether or not Ron thought that Ron considered his relationship with Ron to be "serious."
"Well, I would, but he's always asleep when I go and see him!" said Ron fretfully.
"Is he?" said Ron, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of Weasley and Weasley's row and keen m abuse Weasley as much as possible.
"Is Ron Weasley still visiting him?" Ron demanded suddenly.
"Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?" said Ron uncomfortably.
"Friends, don't make me laugh," said Ron scornfully. "She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting. ..."
"Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?" asked Ron. "Anyway -- sorry, got to go -- there's Weasley coming for a talk about Quidditch," said Ron hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take
him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Ron nor Weasley could follow him.
On the morning of the Quidditch match against Weasley, Ron dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very agitated; Ron Weasley would not let him go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him.
"So how's Weasley shaping up?" he asked Ron nervously, apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice.
"I've told you," said Ron patiently, "he could be world-class and I wouldn't want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I can't wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people," Ron added, getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, "will you stop pretending to be asleep when Ron comes to see you? She's driving me mad as well."
"Oh," said Ron, looking sheepish. "Yeah. All right."
"If you don't want to go out with her anymore, just tell her," said Ron.
"Yeah . . . well. . . it's not that easy, is it?" said Ron. He paused. "Ron going to look in before the match?" he added casually.
"No, she's already gone down to the pitch with Ron."
"Oh," said Ron, looking rather glum. "Right. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag -- I mean, Weasley."
"I'll try," said Ron, shouldering his broom. "See you after the match."
He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. He was looking out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Weasley walking toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and resentful.
Weasley stopped short at the sight of Ron, then gave a short, humorless laugh and continued walking.
"Where're you going?" Ron demanded.
"Yeah, I'm really going to tell you, because it's your business, Weasley," sneered Weasley. "You'd better hurry up, they'll be waiting for 'the Ronsen Captain' -- 'the Boy Who Scored' -- whatever they call you these days."
One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Ron stared at her. She blushed. Weasley pushed past Ron and she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.
Ron stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet
there was Weasley, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Ron's best chance yet of discovering what Weasley was up to. The silent seconds trickled past, and Ron remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where Weasley had vanished. . . .
"Where have you been?" demanded Ron, as Ron sprinted into the changing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs.
"I met Weasley," Ron told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head.
"So I wanted to know how come he's up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here. ..."
"Does it matter right now?"
"Well, I'm not likely to find out, am I?" said Ron, seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. "Come on then!"
And without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos.
There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.
"Tricky conditions!" Weasley said bracingly to the team. "Coote, Peakes, you'll want to fly out of the sun, so they don't see you coming --"
"I'm the Captain, Weasley, shut up giving them instructions," said Ron angrily. "Just get up by the goal posts!"
Once Weasley had marched off, Ron turned to Coote and Peakes.
"Make sure you do fly out of the sun," he told them grudgingly.
He shook hands with the Weasley Captain, and then, on Ron Weasley's whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If he could catch it good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle, seize the Marauder's Map, and find out what Weasley was doing. . . .
"And that's Weasley of Weasley with the Quaffle," said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. "He did the commentary last time, of course, and Ron Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it. Weasley was being quite rude about Weasley, I expect he regrets that now he's playing them -- oh, look, he's lost the Quaffle, Ron took it from him, I do like her, she's very nice. ..."
Ron stared down at the commentator's podium. Surely nobody in their right mind would have let Ron Weasley commentate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside Ron, Professor Weasley was looking
slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment.
". . . but now that big Weasley player's got the Quaffle from , her, I can't remember his name, it's something like Bibble -- no, Buggins --"
"It's Cadwallader!" said Professor Weasley loudly from beside Ron. The crowd laughed.
Ron stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored. Weasley had been shouting criticism at Ron for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.
"Weasley, will you pay attention to what you're supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!" bellowed Ron, wheeling around to face his Keeper.
"You're not setting a great example!" Weasley shouted back, red-faced and furious.
"And Ron Weasley's now having an argument with his Keeper," said Ron serenely, while both Weasleys and Weasleys below in the crowd cheered and jeered. "I don't think that'll help him find the Snitch, but maybe it's a clever ruse. ..."
Swearing angrily, Ron spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.
Ron and Ron scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Ron did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowd's attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Ron Weasley, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from something called "Loser's Lurgy."
"Seventy-forty to Weasley!" barked Professor Weasley into Ron's megaphone.
"Is it, already?" said Ron vaguely. "Oh, look! The Weasley Keeper's got hold of one of the Beater's bats."
Ron spun around in midair. Sure enough, Weasley, for reasons best known to himself, had pulled Peakes's bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader.
"Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!" roared Ron, pelting toward Weasley just as Weasley took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.
A blinding, sickening pain ... a flash of light. . . distant screams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel. . .
And the next thing Ron knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.
"Nice of you to drop in," said Ron, grinning.
Ron blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago ... as had any hope of cornering Weasley. Ron's head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.
"What happened?"
"Cracked skull," said Ron Weasley, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. "Nothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I'm keeping you in overnight. You shouldn't over exert yourself for a few hours."
"I don't want to stay here overnight," said Ron angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. "I want to find Weasley and kill him."
"I'm afraid that would come under the heading of 'overexertion,'" said Ron Weasley, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her
wand in a threatening manner. "You will stay here until I discharge you, Weasley, or I shall call the headmaster."
She bustled back into her office, and Ron sank back into his pillows, fuming.
"D'you know how much we lost by?" he asked Ron through clenched teeth.
"Well, yeah I do," said Ron apologetically. "Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty."
"Brilliant," said Ron savagely. "Really brilliant! When I get hold of Weasley --"
"You don't want to get hold of him, he's the size of a troll," said
Ron reasonably. "Personally, I think there's a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince's. Anyway, the rest of the team might've dealt with him before you get out of here, they're not happy. ..."
There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice; Ron could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that Weasley had messed up so badly. Ron lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.
"I could hear the match commentary from here," said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. "I hope Ron always commentates from now on. . . . Loser's Lurgy ..."
But Ron was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and after a while Ron's snorts subsided.
"Ron came in to visit while you were unconscious," he said, after a long pause, and Ron's imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ron, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing. . . ."She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough."
"Oh . . ." said Ron, as the scene in his mind's eye imploded. "Yeah . . . well, I saw Weasley sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn't look like they wanted to be with him, and that's the second time he's made sure he isn't down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember?" Ron sighed. "Wish I'd followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . ."
"Don't be stupid," said Ron sharply. "You couldn't have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Weasley, you're the Captain!"
"I want to know what he's up to," said Ron. "And don't tell nn its all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Weasley --"
"I never said it was all in your head," said Ron, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at Ron, "but there's no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! You're getting a bit obsessed with Weasley, Ron. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him ..."
"I want to catch him at it!" said Ron in frustration. "I mean, where's he going when he disappears off the map?"
"I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?" suggested Ron, yawning.
"I've never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map. I thought they were being watched now anyway?"
"Well then, I dunno," said Ron.
Silence fell between them. Ron stared up at the circle of lamp light above him, thinking. . . .
If only he had Ron Weasley's power, he would have been able to set a tail upon Weasley, but unfortunately Ron did not have an office full of Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules. . . .
There was a low, rumbling snore from Ron's bed. After a while Ron Weasley came out of her office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It
was easiest to feign sleep; Ron rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed.
This was, Ron reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept Professor Weasley. . . . That had been his most painful injury by far ... he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the --
Ron sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He had the solution at last: There was a way to have Weasley followed -- how could he have forgotten, why hadn't he thought
of it before?
But the question was, how to call him? What did you do? Quietly, tentatively, Ron spoke into the darkness.
"Ron?"
There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.
"What's going -- ?"
Ron pointed his wand hastily at the door of Ron Weasley's office and muttered, "Muffliato!" so that she would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at
what was going on.
Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there was another loud bang, and Ron the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.
"I was watching that, Potty!" he told Ron indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. "Look at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy --"
"Ron will not insult Ron Weasley in front of Ron, no he won't, or Ron will shut Ron's mouth for him!" cried Ron in a high-pitched voice.
"-- kicky, scratchy!" cried Ron happily, now pelting bits of' chalk at the elves to enrage them further. "Tweaky, pokey!"
"Ron will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Ron's mistress say -- ?"
Exactly what Ron's mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment Ron sank his knobbly little fist into Ron’s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Ron and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Ron, who swooped around the lamp squealing, "Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies --"
Ron aimed his wand at Ron and said, "Langlock!" Ron clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.
"Nice one," said Ron appreciatively, lifting Ron into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Ron. "That was another Prince hex, wasn't it?"
"Yeah," said Ron, twisting Ron's wizened arm into a half nelson. "Right -- I'm forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Ron, you're forbidden to fight Ron. Ron, I know I'm not allowed to give you orders --"
"Ron is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Ron will do whatever Ron Weasley wants him to do!" said Ron, tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper.
"Okay then," said Ron, and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.
"Master called me?" croaked Ron, sinking into a bow even as he gave Ron a look that plainly wished him a painful death.
"Yeah, I did," said Ron, glancing toward Ron Weasley's office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. "I've got a job for you."
"Ron will do whatever Master wants," said Ron, sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes, "because Ron has no choice, but Ron is ashamed to have such a master, yes --"
"Ron will do it, Ron Weasley!" squeaked Ron, his tennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming in tears. "Ron would be honored to help Ron Weasley!"
"Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you," said Ron. "Okay then ... I want you to tail Ron Weasley."
Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron's face, Ron went on, "I want to know where he's going, who he's meeting, and what he's doing. I want you to follow him around the clock."
"Yes, Ron Weasley!" said Ron at once, his great eyes shining with excitement. "And if Ron does it wrong, Ron will throw himself off the topmost tower, Ron Weasley!"
"There won't be any need for that," said Ron hastily.
"Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Weasleys?" croaked Ron. "Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old mistress?"
"That's the one," said Ron, foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately. "And you're forbidden to tip him off, Ron, or to show him what you're up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or ... or to contact him in any way. Got it?"
He thought he could see Ron struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited. After a moment or two, and to Rons great satisfaction, Ron bowed deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, "Master thinks of everything, and Ron must obey him even though Ron would much rather be the servant of the Weasley boy, oh yes. . . ."
"That's settled, then," said Ron. "I'll want regular reports, but make sure I'm not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Ron are okay. And don't tell anyone what you're doing. Just stick to Weasley like a couple of wart plasters."
Chapter 20: Lord Weasley's Request
Ron and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by the ministrations of Ron Weasley and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned, the best of which was that Ron was friends with Ron again. Ron even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ron had argued with Ron. The drowsing creature in Ron's chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.
"What did they row about?" he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying.
"It's all right!" said Ron kindly, hurrying forward to help her. "Here ..."
She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, "Reparo." The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her.
"I swear they're getting smaller," he said.
"Never mind her," said Ron, a little impatiently. "What did Ron and Ron row about, Ron?"
"Oh, Ron was laughing about Weasley hitting that Bludgu at you," said Ron.
"It must've looked funny," said Ron reasonably. "It didn't look funny at all!" said Ron hotly. "It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn't caught Ron he could have been very badly hurt!"
"Yeah, well, there was no need for Ron and Ron to split up over it," said Ron, still trying to sound casual. "Or are they still together?"
"Yes, they are -- but why are you so interested?" asked Ron, giving Ron a sharp look.
"I just don't want my Quidditch team messed up again!" he said hastily, but Ron continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, "Ron!" giving him an excuse to turn his back on her. "Oh, hi, Ron."
- "I went to the hospital wing to find you," said Ron, rummaging in her bag. "But they said you'd left..."
She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron's hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Ron.
". . . I've been told to give you this."
It was a small roll of parchment, which Ron recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Weasley.
"Tonight," he told Ron and Ron, once he had unrolled it.
"Nice commentary last match!" said Ron to Ron as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Ron smiled vaguely.
"You're making fun of me, aren't you?" she said. "Everyone says I was dreadful."
"No, I'm serious!" said Ron earnestly. "I can't remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?" he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level.
"Oh, it's a Gurdyroot," she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. "You can keep it if you like, I've got a few of them. They're really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies." And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.
"You know, she's grown on me, Ron," he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. "I know she's insane, but it's in a good --" He stopped talking very suddenly. Ron Weasley was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous. "Hi," said Ron nervously.
"C'mon," Ron muttered to Ron, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Ron say, "Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?"
Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Ron, Ron did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Ron was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Ron saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Ron's Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Ron would then let Ron copy his work.
"Thanks a lot, Ron," said Ron, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o'clock. "Listen, I’ve got to hurry or I'll be late for Weasley. ..."
She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Ron hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Ron took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.
"Enter," called Weasley, but as Ron put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Weasley.
"Aha!" she cried, pointing dramatically at Ron as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles.
"So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Weasley!"
"My dear Ron," said Weasley in a slightly exasperated voice, "there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Ron does have an appointment, and I really don't think there is any more to be said --"
"Very well," said Professor Weasley, in a deeply wounded voice. "If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. ...
Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. ..."
She pushed past Ron and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Ron guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls.
"Please close the door and sit down, Ron," said Weasley, sounding rather tired.
Ron obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Weasley's desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.
"Professor Weasley still isn't happy Ron is teaching, then?" Ron asked.
"No," said Weasley, "Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Ron to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Ron Weasley to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know -- and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her -- that she made the prophecy about you and Weasley, you see."
Weasley heaved a deep sigh, then said, "But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly -- have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?"
"Ah," said Ron, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Ron Weasley was up to, Ron had almost forgotten about the memory Weasley had asked him to extract from Professor Weasley. "Well, I asked Professor Weasley about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn't give it to me." There was a little silence.
"I see," said Weasley eventually, peering at Ron over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Ron the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. "And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity?
That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?"
"Well," Ron stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. "Well . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Weasley. I thought maybe if I got Professor Weasley in a good enough mood --" "And did that work?" asked Weasley. "Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned --" "-- which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it."
A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Ron’s head all the way down his body. Weasley had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Ron would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.
"Sir," he said, a little desperately, "it isn't that I wasn't bothered or anything, I've just had other -- other things . . ."
"Other things on your mind," Weasley finished the sentence for him. "I see."
Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Ron had ever experienced with Weasley; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Weasley's head. Ron felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, "Professor Weasley, I'm really sorry. I should have done more. ... I should have realized you wouldn't have asked me to do it if it wasn't really important."
"Thank you for saying that, Ron," said Weasley quietly. "May I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory."
"I'll do it, sir, I'll get it from him," he said earnestly.
"Then we shall say no more about it just now," said Weasley more kindly, "but continue with our story where we left off. You remember where that was?"
"Yes, sir," said Ron quickly. "Weasley killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Ron did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor Weasley about Horcruxes," he mumbled shamefacedly.
"Very good," said Weasley. "Now, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?"
"Yes, sir".
"Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Weasley did until the age of seventeen?"
Ron nodded.
"But now, Ron," said Weasley, "now things become murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Weasley, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Weasley. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you." Weasley indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. "I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely."
The idea that Weasley valued his opinion this highly made Ron feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Weasley raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.
"I hope you are not tired of diving into other people's memories, for they are curious recollections, these two," he said. "This first one came from a
very old house-elf by the name of Ron. Before we see what Ron witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Weasley left Hogwarts.
"He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Ron Weasley, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Weasley amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Weasley was working at Borgin and Burkes."
"At Borgin and Burkes?" Ron repeated, stunned.
"At Borgin and Burkes," repeated Weasley calmly. "I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Ron's memory. But this was not Weasley's first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time -- I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided -- but Weasley first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher."
"He wanted to stay here? Why?" asked Ron, more amazed still.
"I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet," said Weasley. "Firstly, and very importantly, Weasley was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been
to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home."
Ron felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too.
"Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Weasley had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.
"And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Weasley, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Weasley envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army."
"But he didn't get the job, sir?"
"No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach."
"How did you feel about that, sir?" asked Ron hesitantly. "Deeply uneasy," said Weasley. "I had advised Armando against the appointment
-- I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Weasley and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Weasley back at this school, and especially not in a position of power."
"Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?"
Somehow, Ron knew the answer even before Weasley gave it.
"Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.
"So Weasley went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Weasley was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Ron, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Weasley was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this."
"I'll bet he was," said Ron, unable to contain himself.
"Well, quite," said Weasley, with a faint smile. "And now it is time to hear from Ron the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Ron Weasley."
Weasley tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, "After you, Ron."
Ron got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house-elf Ron had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.
"Hurry up, Ron!" said Ron imperiously. "He said he'd come at four, it's only a couple of minutes to and he's never been late yet!"
She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top of the elf's head barely reached the seat of Ron's chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga.
"How do I look?" said Ron, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror.
"Lovely, madam," squeaked Ron.
Ron could only assume that it was down in Ron’s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Ron Weasley looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.
A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.
"Quick, quick, he's here, Ron!" cried Ron and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.
The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Ron had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Weasley. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Ron's fat little hand, brushing it with his lips.
"I brought you flowers," he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere.
"You naughty boy, you shouldn't have!" squealed old Ron, though Ron noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little
table. "You do spoil this old lady, Ron. ... Sit down, sit down. . . . Where's Ron? Ah ..."
The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress's elbow.
"Help yourself, Ron," said Ron, "I know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I've said it a hundred times. ..."
Weasley smiled mechanically and Ron simpered.
"Well, what's your excuse for visiting this time?" she asked, bat-ring her lashes.
"Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor," said Weasley. "Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair --"
"Now, now, not so fast, or I’ll think you're only here for my trinkets!" pouted Ron.
"I am ordered here because of them," said Weasley quietly. "I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire --"
"Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!" said Ron, waving a little hand. "I've something to show you that I've never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Ron? Will you promise you won't tell Mr. Burke I've got it? He'd never let me rest if he knew I'd shown it to you, and I'm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Ron, you'll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it."
"I'd be glad to see anything Miss Ron shows me," said Weasley quietly, and Ron gave another girlish giggle.
"I had Ron bring it out for me . . . Ron, where are you? I want to show Mr. Weasley our finest treasure. ... In fact, bring both, while you're at it. ..."
"Here, madam," squeaked the house-elf, and Ron saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools.
"Now," said Ron happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, "I think you'll like this, Ron. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can't wait to get their hands on this!"
She opened the lid. Ron edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.
"I wonder whether you know what it is, Ron? Pick it up, have a good look!" whispered Ron, and Weasley stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Ron thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Ron’s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Weasley's handsome features.
"A badger," murmured Weasley, examining the engraving upon the cup. "Then this was . . . ?"
"Ron Weasley's, as you very well know, you clever boy!" said Ron, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. "Didn't I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn't it? And all sorts of powers it's supposed to possess too, but I haven't tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . ."
She hooked the cup back off Weasley's long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Weasley's face as the cup was taken away.
"Now then," said Ron happily, "where’s Ron? Oh yes, there you are -- take that away now, Ron."
The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Ron turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap.
"I think you'll like this even more, Ron," she whispered. "Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I've got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he'd love to get it back when I'm gone. ..."
She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.
Weasley reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.
"Weasley's mark," he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S.
"That's right!" said Ron, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Weasley gazing at her locket, transfixed. "I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn't let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value --"
There was no mistaking it this time: Weasley's eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Ron saw his knuckles whiten on the locket's chain.
"-- I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isn't it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. . . ."
She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Ron thought Weasley was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.
"So there you are, Ron, clear, and I hope you enjoyed that!"
She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Ron saw her foolish smile falter.
"Are you all right, dear?"
"Oh yes," said Weasley quietly. "Yes, I'm very well. ..."
"I thought -- but a trick of the light, I suppose --" said Ron, looking unnerved, and Ron guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Weasley's eyes. "Here, Ron, take these away and lock them up again. ... The usual enchantments...
"Time to leave, Ron," said Weasley quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Weasley grasped Ron once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Weasley's office.
"Ron Weasley died two days after that little scene," said Weasley, resuming his seat and indicating that Ron should do the same. "Ron the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress's evening cocoa by accident."
"No way!" said Ron angrily.
"I see we are of one mind," said Weasley. "Certainly, then are many similarities between this death and that of the Weasleys. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death --" "Ron confessed?"
"She remembered putting something in her mistress's cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison, said Weasley. "It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused --"
"Weasley modified her memory, just like he did with Ron!" "Yes, that is my conclusion too," said Weasley. "And, just as with Ron, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Ron --"
"-- because she was a house-elf," said Ron. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Ron had set up, S.P.E.W. "Precisely," said Weasley. "She was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Ron, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over -- but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Weasley knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.
"By the time Ron was convicted, Ron's family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of
this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Ron so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Ron Weasley for a very long time.
"Now," said Weasley, "if you don't mind, Ron, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Weasley had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Weasleys, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Ron’s ring, so he ran off now with Rons cup and locket."
"But," said Ron, frowning, "it seems mad. . . . Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those . . ."
"Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Weasley," said Weasley. "I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Ron, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his." "The locket maybe," said Ron, "but why take the cup as well?"
"It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders," said Weasley. "I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I think. ... I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course.
"And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Weasley's memory for us. Ten years separates Ron’s memory and this one, ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Weasley was doing. . . ." Ron got to his feet once more as Weasley emptied the last memory into the Pensieve.
"Whose memory is it?" he asked. "Mine," said Weasley.
And Ron dived after Weasley through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had just left. There was Ron slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Weasley, who looked very similar to the Weasley standing beside Ron, though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge.
The younger Weasley seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, "Enter."
Ron let out a hastily stifled gasp. Weasley had entered the room. His features were not those Ron had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Ron Weasley. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Ron knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.
The Weasley behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently this visit had been made by appointment.
"Good evening, Ron," said Weasley easily. "Won't you sit down?"
"Thank you," said Weasley, and he took the seat to which Weasley had gestured -- the very seat, by the looks of it, that Ron had just vacated in the present. "I heard that you had become headmaster," he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. "A worthy choice."
"I am glad you approve," said Weasley, smiling. "May I offer you a drink?"
"That would be welcome," said Weasley. "I have come a long way."
Weasley stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Weasley a
goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his desk. . "So, Ron ... to what do I owe the pleasure?"
Weasley did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.
"They do not call me 'Ron' anymore," he said. "These days, 1 am known as --"
"I know what you are known as," said Weasley, smiling, pleasantly. "But to me, I'm afraid, you will always be Ron Weasley. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges' youthful beginnings."
He raised his glass as though toasting Weasley, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Ron felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Weasley's refusal to use Weasley’s chosen name was a refusal to allow Weasley to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Ron could tell that Weasley took it as such.
"I am surprised you have remained here so long," said Weasley after a short pause. "I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school."
"Well," said Weasley, still smiling, "to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too."
"I see it still," said Weasley. "I merely wondered why you -- who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister --"
"Three times at the last count, actually," said Weasley. "But the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think."
Weasley inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine. Weasley did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Weasley to talk first.
"I have returned," he said, after a little while, "later, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard."
Weasley considered Weasley over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking.
"Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us," he said quietly. "Rumors of your doings have reached your old school, Ron. I should be sorry to believe half of them."
Weasley's expression remained impassive as he said, "Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Weasley."
"You call it 'greatness,' what you have been doing, do you?" asked Weasley delicately.
"Certainly," said Weasley, and his eyes seemed to burn red. "I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed --"
"Of some kinds of magic," Weasley corrected him quietly. "Of some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant."
For the first time, Weasley smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage.
"The old argument," he said softly. "But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Weasley."
"Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places," suggested Weasley.
"Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts?" said Weasley. "Will you let me return? Will you let me share
my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command."
Weasley raised his eyebrows. "And what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves -- or so rumor has it -- the Death Eaters?"
Ron could tell that Weasley had not expected Weasley to know this name; he saw Weasley’s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.
"My friends," he said, after a moment's pause, "will carry on without me, I am sure."
"I am glad to hear that you consider them friends," said Weasley. "I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants."
"You are mistaken," said Weasley.
"Then if I were to go to the Hog's Head tonight, I would not find a group of them -- Weasley, Rosier, Muldber, Weasley -- awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post."
There could be no doubt that Weasley's detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Weasley; however, he rallied almost at once.
"You are omniscient as ever, Weasley."
"Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen," said Weasley lightly. "Now, Ron . . ."
Weasley set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture.
"Let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?"
Weasley looked coldly surprised. "A job I do not want? On the contrary, Weasley, I want it very much."
"Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you're after, Ron? Why not try an open request for once?"
Weasley sneered. "If you do not want to give me a job --"
"Of course I don't," said Weasley. "And I don't think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose."
Weasley stood up. He looked less like Ron Weasley than ever, his features thick with rage. "This is your final word?"
"It is," said Weasley, also standing.
"Then we have nothing more to say to each other."
"No, nothing," said Weasley, and a great sadness filled his face. "The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Ron. ... I wish I could. . . ."
For a second, Ron was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Weasley's hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Weasley had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone.
Ron felt Weasley's hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Weasley's hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.
"Why?" said Ron at once, looking up into Weasley's face. "Why did he come back? Did you ever find out?"
"I have ideas," said Weasley, "but no more than that."
"What ideas, sir?"
"I shall tell you, Ron, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Weasley," said Weasley.
"When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear ... to both of us."
Ron was still burning with curiosity and even though Weasley had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.
"Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn't say. ..."
"Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job," said Weasley. "The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Weasley."
Chapter 21: The Unknowable Room
Ron wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Weasley to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before.
"You won't find anything in there," said Ron firmly, late on Sunday evening.
"Don't start, Ron," said Ron. "If it hadn't been for the Prince, Ron wouldn't be sitting here now."
"He would if you'd just listened to Weasley in our first year," said Ron dismissively.
Ron ignored her. He had just found an incantation "Sectum-sempra!" scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words "For enemies," and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Ron. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page. They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a cer-tain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the
option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.
Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not man-aged to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Ron, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Ron, who would not be seventeen for an-other four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.
"At least you can Apparate, though!" said Ron tensely. "You'll have no trouble come July!"
"I've only done it once," Ron reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson.
Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Weasley that Ron and Ron had already completed. Ron fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Weasley on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Weasleys memory was the most important thing to him now.
"I'm telling you, the stupid Prince isn't going to be able to help you with this, Ron!" said Ron, more loudly. "There's only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that's the Imperius Curse, which is illegal --"
"Yeah, I know that, thanks," said Ron, not looking up from the book. "That's why I'm looking for something different. Dumbledorf says Veritaserum won't do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . ."
"You're going about it the wrong way," said Ron. "Only you can get the memory, Weasley says. That must mean you can persuade Weasley where other people can’t. It's not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that --"
"How do you spell 'belligerent'?" said Ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. "It can't be B -- U -- M --"
"No, it isn't," said Ron, pulling Ron's essay toward her. "And 'augury' doesn't begin O -- R -- G either. What kind of quill are you using?"
"It's one of Ron and Ron's Spell-Check ones, but I think the charm must be wearing off."
"Yes, it must," said Ron, pointing at the title of his essay, "because we were asked how we'd deal with dementors, not 'Dug-bogs', and I don't remember you changing your name to 'Roonil Wazlib’ either."
"Ah no!" said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. "Don't say I'll have to write the whole thing out again!"
"It's okay, we can fix it," said Ron, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand.
"I love you, Ron," said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rub-bing his eyes wearily. Ron turned faintly pink, but merely said, "Don't let Ron hear you saying that."
"1 won't," said Ron into his hands. "Or maybe I will, then she'll ditch me."
"Why don't you ditch her if you want to finish it?" asked Ron.
"You haven't ever chucked anyone, have you?" said Ron. "You and Ron just --"
"Sort of fell apart, yeah," said Ron.
"Wish that would happen with me and Ron," said Ron gloomily, watching Ron silently tapping each of his mis-spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. "But the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It's like going out with the giant squid."
"There," said Ron, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron's essay.
"Thanks a million," said Ron. "Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion?" Ron, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood
Prince's notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Ron having just gone up to bed cursing Weasley and his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Ron's quill. Ron had just closed the Half-Blood Prince's book, yawning, when --
Crack!
Ron let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Ron said, "Ron!"
The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. "Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Weasley boy is doing, so Ron has come to give--"
Crack!
Ron appeared alongside Ron, his tea-cozy hat askew. "Ron has been helping too, Ron Weasley!" he squeaked, cast-ing Ron a resentful look. "And Ron ought to tell Ron when he is coming to see Ron Weasley so they can make their re-ports together!"
"What is this?" asked Ron, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. "What's going on, Ron?" Ron hesitated before answering, because he had not told Her-mione about setting Ron and Ron to tail Weasley; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her.
"Well. . . they've been following Weasley for me," he said.
"Night and day," croaked Ron.
"Ron has not slept for a week, Ron Weasley!" said Ron proudly, swaying where he stood. Ron looked indignant.
"You haven't slept, Ron? But surely, Ron, you didn't tell him not to --"
"No, of course I didn't," said Ron quickly. "Ron, you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything?" he has-tened to ask, before Ron could intervene again.
"Master Weasley moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood," croaked Ron at once. "His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of--"
"Ron Weasley is a bad boy!" squeaked Ron angrily. "A bad boy who -- who --" He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it. Ron, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Ron struggled, then went limp.
"Thank you, Ron Weasley," he panted. "Ron still finds it dif-ficult to speak ill of his old masters." Ron released him; Ron straightened his tea
cozy and said defiantly to Ron, "But Ron should know that Ron Weasley is not a good master to a house-elf!"
"Yeah, we don't need to hear about you being in love with Weasley," Ron told Ron. "Let's fast forward to where he's actually been going."
Ron bowed again, looking furious, and then said, "Master Weasley eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dun-geons, he attends his classes in a variety of--"
"Ron, you tell me," said Ron, cutting across Ron. "Has he been going anywhere he shouldn't have?"
"Ron Weasley, sir," squeaked Ron, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, "the Weasley boy is breaking no rules that Ron can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters --"
"The Room of Requirement!" said Ron, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Ron and Ron stared at him. "That's where he's been sneaking off to! That's where he's doing... whatever he's doing! And I bet that's why he's been disappearing off the map -- come to think of it, I've never seen the Room of Requirement on there!"
"Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there," said Ron.
"I think it'll be part of the magic of the room," said Ron. "If you need it to be unplottable, it will be."
"Ron, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Weasley's doing?" said Ron eagerly.
"No, Ron Weasley, that is impossible," said Ron.
"No, it's not," said Ron at once. "Weasley got into our head-quarters there last year, so I'll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem."
"But I don't think you will, Ron," said Ron slowly. "Mal-foy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn't he, because that stupid Ron had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don't know what the room becomes when Weasley goes in there, so you don't know what to ask it to transform into."
"There'll be a way around that," said Ron dismissively. "You've done brilliantly, Ron."
"Rons done well too," said Ron kindly; but far from looking grateful, Ron averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, "The Mudblood is speaking to Ron, Ron will pretend he cannot hear --"
"Get out of it," Ron snapped at him, and Ron made one last deep bow and Disapparated. "You'd better go and get some sleep too, Ron."
"Thank you, Ron Weasley, sir!" squeaked Ron happily, and he too vanished.
"How good is this?" said Ron enthusiastically, turning to Ron and Ron the moment the room was elf-free again. "We know where Weasley's going! We've got him cornered now!"
"Yeah, it's great," said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink chat had recently been an almost com-pleted essay. Ron pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand.
"But what's all this about him going up there with a variety of students'?" said Ron. "How many people are in on it? You wouldn't think he'd trust lots of them to know what he's do-ing---"
"Yeah, that is weird," said Ron, frowning. "I heard him telling Weasley it wasn't Weasley's business what he was doing... so what's he telling all these... all these..." Ron's voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire. "God, I've been stupid," he said quietly. "Its obvious, isn't it? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time during that lesson. . . ."
"Roned what?" said Ron.
"Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slug-horn showed us in our first Potions lesson... There aren't a whole variety of students standing guard for Weasley... it's just Weasley and Weasley as usual. ...Yeah, it all fits!" said Ron, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. "They're stupid enough to do what they're told even if he won't tell them what he's up to, but he doesn't want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he's got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people... Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch -- ha! Weasley and Weasley!"
"Do you mean to say," said Ron in a hushed voice, "that that little girl whose scales I repaired -- ?"
"Yeah, of course!" said Ron loudly, staring at her. "Of course! Weasley must've been inside the room at the time, so she -- what am I talking about? -- he dropped the scales to tell Weasley not to corne out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! We've been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!"
"He's got Weasley and Weasley transforming into girls?" guffawed Ron. "Blimey... no wonder they don't look too happy these days. I'm surprised they don't tell him to stuff it."
"Well, they wouldn't, would they, if he's shown them his Dark Mark?" said Ron.
"Hmmm... the Dark Mark we don't know exists," said Hermi-one skeptically, rolling up Ron's dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.
"We'll see" said Ron confidently.
"Yes, we will," Ron said, getting to her feet and stretching. "But, Ron, before you get all excited, I still don't think you'll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what's there first'. And I don't think you should forget" -- she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look -- "that what you're supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Weasley. Good night."
Ron watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the girls' dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron. "What d'you think?"
"Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf," said Ron, staring at the spot where Ron had vanished. "I'd have that Apparition Test in the bag."
Ron did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how Weasley was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Ron, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever Ron said, Ron was sure that if Weasley had-=- been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Weasley's, what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A ston room? A workshop? Rons mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken
and disturbed by images of Weasley, who turned into Weasley, who turned into Weasley...
Ron was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement. Ron was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Ron, because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to.
"Look," he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. "I haven't for-gotten about Weasley, but I haven't got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn't I find out what Weasley's doing?"
"I've already told you, you need to persuade Weasley," said Her-mione. "It's not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Weasley could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement" -- she jerked the Prophet out from under Rons hand and unfolded it to look at the front page -- "you should go and find Weasley and start appeal-ing to his better nature."
"Anyone we know -- ?" asked Ron, as Ron scanned the headlines.
"Yes!" said Ron, causing both Ron and Ron to gag on their breakfast. "But it's all right, he's not dead -- its Ron, he's been
arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary, and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse."
They finished their breakfast in silence. Ron set off imme-diately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Weasley's dementor essay, and Ron for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.
Ron slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Ron was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Weasley in-side it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Weasley or Weasley pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.
He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirement's door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, "I need to see what Weasley's doing in here... I need to see what Weasley's doing in here... I need to see what Weasley's doing in here..."
Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it -- but he was still looking at a
stretch of mundanely blank wall. He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding.
"Okay," said Ron aloud. "Okay... I thought the wrong thing..." He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, con-centrating as hard as he could. "I need to see the place where Weasley keeps coming secretly... I need to see the place where Weasley keeps coming secretly..." After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.
There was no door.
"Oh, come off it," he told the wall irritably. "That was a clear instruction. Fine." He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more. "I need you to become the place you become for Ron Weasley..."
He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes.
There was still no door.
Ron swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently un-der the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.
Ron tried every variation of "I need to see what Ron Weasley is doing inside you" that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Ron might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frus-trated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went.
"Late again, Weasley," said Weasley coldly, as Ron hurried into the candlelit classroom. "Ten points from Gryfrindor." Ron scowled at Weasley as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron. Half the class were still on their feet, taking out books and orga-nizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them.
"Before we start, I want your dementor essays," said Weasley, wav-ing his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. "And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page -- what is it, Mr. Weasley?"
"Sir," said Ron, "I've been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius --"
"No, there wasn't," said Weasley in a bored voice.
"But sir, I heard people talking --"
"If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Weasley, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Ron Weasley."
"I thought Weasley and Ron were on the same side," mut-tered Ron to Ron and Ron. "Shouldn't he be upset Mun-dungus has been arrest --"
"But Weasley seems to have a lot to say on the subject," said Weasley, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Ron. "Let us ask Weasley how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost."
The whole class looked around at Ron, who hastily tried to recall what Weasley had told him the night that they had gone to visit Weasley. "Er -- well -- ghosts are transparent --" he said.
"Oh, very good," interrupted Weasley, his lip curling. "Yes, it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Weasley. 'Ghosts are transparent."'
Ron Weasley let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other peo-ple were smirking. Ron took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, "Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren't they? So they'd be solid --"
"A five-year-old could have told us as much," sneered Weasley. "The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wiz-ard's spells. It is
not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard's bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth, and of course, as Weasley so wisely tells us, transparent. "
"Well, what Ron said is the most useful if we're trying to tell them apart!" said Ron. "When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we're going to be having a look to see if its solid, aren't we, we're not going to be asking, 'Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?'" There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Weasley gave the class.
"Another ten points from Weasley," said Weasley. "I would ex-pect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room."
"No!" whispered Ron, grabbing Rons arm as he opened his mouth furiously. "There's no point, you'll just end up in deten-tion again, leave it!"
"Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen," said Weasley, smirking a little, "and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse."
Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Ron caught up with Ron and Ron (Ron mysteriously melted out of sight as she ap-proached) and abused Weasley hotly for his jibe about Ron's Appari-tion, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys' bathroom with Ron.
"Weasley's right, though, isn't he?" said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. "I dunno whether it's worth me taking the test. I just can't get the hang of Apparition."
"You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you," said Ron reasonably. "It'll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you're still not -- you know -- as good as you'd like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summer -- Ron, this is the boys' bathroom!"
The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. "Oh," she said glumly. "It's you two."
"Who were you expecting?" said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.
"Nobody," said Ron, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. "He said he'd come back and see me, but then you said you'd pop in and visit me too" -- she gave Ron a reproachful look -- "and I haven't seen you for months and months. I've learned not to ex-pect too much from boys."
"I thought you lived in that girls' bathroom?" said Ron, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.
"I do," she said, with a sulky little shrug, "but that doesn't mean I cant visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?"
"Vividly," said Ron.
"But I thought he liked me," she said plaintively. "Maybe if you two left, he'd come back again. We had lots in common. I'm sure he felt it."
And she looked hopefully toward the door. "When you say you had lots in common," said Ron, sounding rather amused now, "d'you mean he lives in an S-bend too?"
"No," said Ron defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. "I mean he's sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn't got anybody to talk to, and he's not afraid to show his feelings and cry!"
"There's been a boy in here crying?" said Ron curiously. "A young boy?"
"Never you mind!" said Ron, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. "I promised I wouldn't tell anyone, and I'll take his secret to the --"
"-- not the grave, surely?" said Ron with a snort. "The sewers, maybe." Ron gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, caus-ing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Ron seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. "You're right," he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, "I'll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I de-cide about taking the test."
And so the following weekend, Ron joined Ron and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Ron felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement.
"You'd do better," said Ron, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, "to go straight to Weasley's of-fice and try and get that memory from him."
"I've been trying!" said Ron crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an at-tempt to corner Weasley, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Ron had not been able to catch him. Twice, Ron had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.
"He doesn't want to talk to me, Ron! He can tell I've been trying to get him on his own again, and he's not going to let it happen!"
"Well, you've just got to keep at it, haven't you?"
The short queue of people waiting to file past Weasley, who was do-ing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Ron did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished
Ron and Ron both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Her-mione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.
Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Ron pulled the Ma-rauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," and scanned it carefully.
As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Weasleys in one tower, the Weasleys in another, the Weasleys in the dungeons, and the Weasleys in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Ron Weasley. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Ron was not worried about that; if Weasley was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Ron had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right be-hind her before bending very low and whispering, "Hello...you're very pretty, aren't you?"
Weasley gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corri-dor. Laughing, Ron
turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Ron Weasley was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Ron a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.
Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, hav-ing tried many more variations of his request to see what Weasley was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Ron felt frustrated beyond belief-=Weasley might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Ron ran at the wall and kicked it.
"OUCH!"
He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.
"Ron?"
He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Weasley, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.
"What’re you doing here?" he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor?
"I came to see Weasley," said Weasley. Ron thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mouse-colored hair lank.
"His office isn't here," said Ron, "it's round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle --"
"I know," said Weasley. "He's not there. Apparently he's gone away again."
"Has he?" said Ron, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. "Hey -- you don't know where he goes, I suppose?"
"No," said Weasley.
"What did you want to see him about?"
"Nothing in particular," said Weasley, picking, apparently uncon-sciously, at the sleeve of her robe. "I just thought he might know what's going on. I've heard rumors... people getting hurt."
"Yeah, I know, it's all been in the papers," said Ron. "That lit-tle kid trying to kill his --"
"The Prophet's often behind the times," said Weasley, who didn't seem to be listening to him. "You haven't had any letters from any-one in the Order recently?"
"No one from the Order writes to me anymore," said Ron, "not since Ron --" He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.
"I'm sorry," he muttered awkwardly. "I mean... I miss him, as well."
"What?" said Weasley blankly, as though she had not heard him. "Well. I'll see you around, Ron."
And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Ron to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Ron would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Weasley who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.
He found Ron and Ron in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.
"I did it -- well, kind of!" Ron told Ron enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. "I was supposed to be Apparating to out-side Ron Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshafts, but at least I moved!"
"Good one," said Ron. "How'd you do, Ron?"
"Oh, she was perfect, obviously," said Ron, before Ron could answer. "Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is -- we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should've heard Weasley going on about her -- I'll be surprised if he doesn't pop the question soon --"
"And what about you?" asked Ron, ignoring Ron. "Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?"
"Yep," said Ron. "And guess who I ran into up there? Weasley!"
"Weasley?" repeated Ron and Ron together, looking surprised.
"Yeah, she said she'd come to visit Weasley."
"If you ask me," said Ron once Ron had finished describing his conversation with Weasley, "she's cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry."
"It’s a bit odd," said Ron, who for some reason looked very concerned. "She's supposed to be guarding the school, why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Weasley when he's not even here?"
"I had a thought," said Ron tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Ron’s territory than his. "You don't think she can have been... you know... in love with Ron?"
Ron stared at him. "What on earth makes you say that?"
"I dunno," said Ron, shrugging, "but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name, and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. I wondered whether it hadn't become... you know... him."
"It's a thought," said Ron slowly. "But I still don't know why she'd be bursting into the castle to see Weasley, if that's re-ally why she was here."
"Goes back to what I said, doesn't it?" said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. "She's gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women," he said wisely to Ron, "they're easily upset."
"And yet," said Ron, coming out of her reverie, "I doubt you'd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Ron Ron didn't laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia."
Ron scowled.
Chapter 22: After the Burial
Patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets, but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Ron's mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what Weasley was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Weasley that might lead, somehow, to Weasley hand-ing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades.
"For the last time, just forget about Weasley," Ron told Ron firmly.
They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch. Ron and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet -- Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them -- for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.
Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Ron as a girl came around the corner.
"It isn't Ron," said Ron wearily.
"Oh, good," said Ron, relaxing.
"Ron Weasley?" said the girl. "I was asked to give you this."
"Thanks..."
Ron's heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, "Weasley said we wouldn't be having any more lessons until I got the memory!"
"Maybe he wants to check on how you're doing?" suggested Ron, as Ron unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding Weasley's long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run.
Dear Ron, Ron and Ron!
Ron died last night. Ron and Ron, you met him and you know how special he was.
Ron, I know you'd have liked him.
It would mean a lot to me if you'd nip down for the burial later this evening.
I'm planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day.
I know you're not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak.
Wouldn't ask, but I can't face it alone.
Weasley
"Look at this," said Ron, handing the note to Ron. "Oh, for heaven's sake," she said, scanning it quickly and passing it to Ron, who read it through looking increasingly incredulous. "He's mental" he said furiously. "That thing told its mates to eat Ron and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Weasley ex-pects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!"
"Its not just that," said Ron. "He's asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security's a million times tighter and how much trouble we'd be in if we were caught."
"We've been down to see him by night before," said Ron.
"Yes, but for something like this?" said Ron. "We've risked a lot to help Weasley out, but after all -- Ron's dead. If it were a question of saving him --"
"-- I'd want to go even less," said Ron firmly. "You didn't meet him, Ron. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot."
Ron took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it. Tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment. . . .
"Ron, you can't be thinking of going," said Ron. "It's such a pointless thing to get detention for."
Ron sighed. "Yeah, I know," he said. "I s'pose Weasley'll have to bury Ron without us."
"Yes, he will," said Ron, looking relieved. "Look, Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests. . . . Try and soften Weasley up a bit then!"
"Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think?" said Ron bitterly.
"Lucky," said Ron suddenly. "Ron, that's it -- get lucky!"
"What d'you mean?"
"Use your lucky potion!"
"Ron, that's -- that's it!" said Ron, sounding stunned. "Of course! Why didn't I think of it?"
Ron stared at them both. "Felix Felicis?" he said. "I dunno . . . I was sort of saving it. ..."
"What for?" demanded Ron incredulously.
"What on earth is more important than this memory, Ron?" asked Ron.
Ron did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ron splitting up with Ron, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . .
"Ron? Are you still with us?" asked Ron.
"Wha -- ? Yeah, of course," he said, pulling himself together. "Well. . . okay. If I can't get Weasley to talk this afternoon, I'll take some Felix and have another go this evening."
"That's decided, then," said Ron briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. "Destination . . . determina-tion . . . deliberation . . ." she murmured.
"Oh, stop that," Ron begged her, "I feel sick enough as it is -- quick, hide me!"
"It isn't Ron!" said Ron impatiently, as another cou-ple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.
"Cool," said Ron, peering over Rons shoulder to check. "Blimey, they don't look happy, do they?"
"They're the Montgomery sisters and of course they don't look happy, didn't you hear what happened to their little brother?" said Ron.
"I'm losing track of what's happening to everyone's relatives, to be honest," said Ron.
"Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungos, they couldn't save him."
"He died?" repeated Ron, shocked. "But surely werewolves don't kill, they just turn you into one of them?"
"They sometimes kill," said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. "I've heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away."
"What was the werewolf's name?" said Ron quickly.
"Well, the rumor is that it was that Ron Weasley," said Ron.
"I knew it -- the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Weasley told me about!" said Ron angrily.
Ron looked at him bleakly.
"Ron, you've got to get that memory," she said. "It's all about stopping Weasley, isn't it? These dreadful things that are hap-pening are all down to him. . . ."
The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Ron and Ron jumped to their feet, looking terrified.
"You'll do fine," Ron told them both, as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Ap-parition Test. "Good luck."
"And you too!" said Ron with a significant look, as Ron headed off to the dungeons.
There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Ron, Ron, and Ron Weasley.
"All too young to Apparate just yet?" said Slughorh genially, "Not turned seventeen yet?"
They shook their heads.
"Ah well," said Weasley cheerily, "as we're so few, we'll do something for fun. I want you all to brew me up something amusing!"
"That sounds good, sir," said Ron sycophantically, rubbing his hands together. Weasley, on the other hand, did not crack a smile. "What do you mean, 'something amusing'?" he said irritably. "Oh, surprise me," said Weasley airily.
Weasley opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making with a sulky expression. It could not have been plainer that he thought this les-son was a waste of time. Undoubtedly, Ron thought, watching him over the top of his own book, Weasley was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement.
Was it his imagination, or did Weasley, like Weasley, look thinner! Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had that grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was no air of smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the
Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Weasley. . . . There could be only one conclusion, in Ron's opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly.
Cheered by this thought, Ron skimmed through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood Prince's version of "An Elixir to Induce Euphoria," which seemed not only to meet Weasley's instructions, but which might (Ron's heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Weasley into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if Ron could persuade him to taste some. . . .
"Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful," said Weasley an hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Ron's cauldron. "Euphoria, I take it? And what's that I smell? Mmmm . . . you've added just a sprig of peppermint, haven't you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Ron, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occa-sional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. ... I really don't know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless --"
Ron pushed the Half-Blood Prince's book deeper into his bag with his foot.
"-- it's just your mother's genes coming out in you!"
"Oh . . . yeah, maybe," said Ron, relieved.
Ron was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Ron for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. Weasley was already packing up, sour-faced; Weasley had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely "passable."
The bell rang and both Ron and Weasley left at once. "Sir," Ron began, but Weasley immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Ron, he hurried away as fast as he could.
"Professor -- Professor, don't you want to taste my po -- ?" called Ron desperately.
But Weasley had gone. Disappointed, Ron emptied the caul-dron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.
Ron and Ron returned in the late afternoon.
"Ron!" cried Ron as she climbed through the portrait hole. "Ron, I passed!"
"Well done!" he said. "And Ron?"
"He -- he just failed," whispered Ron, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. "It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the
examiner just spotted that he'd left half an eyebrow behind. . . How did it go with Weasley?"
"No joy," said Ron, as Ron joined them. "Bad luck, mate, but you'll pass next time -- we can take it together."
"Yeah, I s'pose," said Ron grumpily. "But half an eyebrow – like that matters!"
"I know," said Ron soothingly, "it does seem really harsh. ..."
They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner, and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of Weasley and the memory.
"So, Ron -- you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?" Ron demanded.
"Yeah, I s'pose I'd better," said Ron. "I don't reckon I'll need all of it, not twenty-four hours' worth, it can't take all night.... I'll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it."
"It's a great feeling when you take it," said Ron reminiscently. "Like you can't do anything wrong."
"What are you talking about?" said Ron, laughing. "You've never taken any!"
"Yeah, but I thought I had, didn't I?" said Ron, as though ex-plaining the obvious. "Same difference really ..."
As they had only just seen Weasley enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Ron should go to Weasley s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbid-den Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after check-ing carefully that Ron, Ron, and Ron were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys' dormitory.
Ron took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.
"Well, here goes," said Ron, and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp.
"What does it feel like?" whispered Ron.
Ron did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all... and getting the memory from Weasley seemed suddenly not only pos-sible, but positively easy. . . .
He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.
"Excellent," he said. "Really excellent. Right. . . I'm going down to Weasley's."
"What?" said Ron and Ron together, looking aghast.
"No, Ron -- you've got to go and see Weasley, remember?" said Ron.
"No," said Ron confidently. "I'm going to Weasley's, I've got a good feeling about going to Weasley's."
"You've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?" asked Ron, looking stunned.
"Yeah," said Ron, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. "I feel like it's the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?"
"No," said Ron and Ron together, both looking positively alarmed now.
"This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?" said Ron anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. "You haven't got another little bottle full of-- I don't know --"
"Essence of Insanity?" suggested Ron, as Ron swung his cloak over his shoulders.
Ron laughed, and Ron and Ron looked even more alarmed.
"Trust me," he said. "I know what I'm doing ... or at least" he strolled confidently to the door-- "Felix does."
He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Ron hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Ron slid through the open door.
"What were you doing up there with her!" shrieked Ron Weasley, staring right through Ron at Ron and Ron emerging together from the boys' dormitories. Ron heard Ron splutter-ing behind him as he darted across the room away from them.
Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ron and Ron came through it, and Ron was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ron.
"Don't push me, please, Ron," she said, sounding annoyed. ; "You're always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. ..."
The portrait swung closed behind Ron, but not before he had heard Ron make an angry retort.. . . His feeling of elation in-creasing, Ron strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.
Why he knew that going to Weasley's was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Weasley came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the en-trance hall he saw that Weasley had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Ron threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk.
It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Weasley's. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Ron that this was a whim on which he should act, so he di-rected his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Weasley in conversation with Professor Weasley. Ron lurked be-hind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation.
"I do thank you for taking the time, Ron," Weasley was saying courteously, "most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight."
"Oh, I quite agree," said Professor Weasley warmly. "That enough for you?"
"Plenty, plenty," said Weasley, who, Ron saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. "This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third
years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!"
Professor Weasley headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Weasley directed his steps to the spot where Ron stood, invisible.
Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Ron pullet I off the cloak with a flourish.
"Good evening, Professor."
"Merlin’s beard, Ron, you made me jump," said Slughotn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. "How did you get out of the castle?"
"I think Weasley must've forgotten to lock the doors," said Ron cheerfully, and was delighted to see Weasley scowl.
"I'll be reporting that man, he's more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out then, Ron?"
"Well, sir, it's Weasley," said Ron, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. "He's pretty upset. . . But you won't tell anyone, Professor? I don't want trouble for him. ..."
Weasley's curiosity was evidently aroused. "Well, I can't promise that," he said gruffly. "But I know that Weasley trusts Weasley to the hilt, so I'm sure he can't be up to anything very dreadful. .."
"Well, it's this giant spider, he's had it for years. ... It lived in the forest. ... It could talk and everything --"
"I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest," said Weasley softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. "It's true, then?"
"Yes," said Ron. "But this one, Ron, the first one Weasley ever got, it died last night. He's devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said I'd go."
"Touching, touching," said Weasley absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Weasley's cabin. "But acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn't want to do anything insensitive if Weasley is upset. . . but if there was any way to procure some ... I mean, its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive. ..."
Weasley seemed to be talking more to himself than Ron now. ". . . seems an awful waste not to collect it... might get a hun-dred Galleons a pint. ... To be frank, my salary is not large. . . ."
And now Ron saw clearly what was to be done. "Well," he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, "well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Weasley
would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Ron a better send-off, you know ..."
"Yes, of course," said Weasley, his eyes now gleaming with en-thusiasm. "I tell you what, Ron, I'll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . We'll drink the poor beast's -- well -- not health -- but we'll send it off in style, anyway, once it's buried. And I'll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occa-sion. . . ."
He bustled back into the castle, and Ron sped off to Weasley's, delighted with himself.
"Yen came," croaked Weasley, when he opened the door and saw Ron emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.
"Yeah -- Ron and Ron couldn't, though," said Ron. "They're really sorry."
"Don -- don matter . . . Hed've bin touched yeh're here, though, Ron. . ."
Weasley gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Ron patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Weasley he could easily reach.
"Where are we burying him?" he asked. "The forest?"
"Blimey, no," said Weasley, wiping his streaming eyes on the bot-tom of his shirt. "The other spiders won' let me anywhere near their webs now Ron's gone. Turns out it was only on his orders they didn' eat me! Can yeh believe that, Ron?"
The honest answer was "yes"; Ron recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the aero-mantulas. They had been quite clear that Ron was the only thing that stopped them from eating Weasley.
"Never bin an area o' the forest I couldn' go before!" said Weasley, shaking his head. "It wasn' easy, gettin' Ron's body out o' there, I can tell yeh -- they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give 'im a nice burial... a proper send-off. . ."
He broke into sobs again and Ron resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), "Professor Weasley met me coming down here, Weasley."
"Not in trouble, are yeh?" said Weasley, looking up, alarmed. "Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the evenin', I know it, it's my fault --"
"No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he'd like to come and pay his last respects to Ron too," said Ron.
"He's gone to change into something more suitable, I think...and he said he'd bring some bottles so we can drink to Ron's mem-ory..."
"Did he?" said Weasley, looking both astonished and touched. "Tha's -- tha's righ' nice of him, that is, an' not turnin' yeh in ei-ther. I've never really had a lot ter do with Ron Weasley before. .. . Comin' ter see old Ron off, though, eh? Well. . . he’d've liked that, Ron would. . . ."
Ron thought privately that what Ron would have liked most about Weasley was the ample amount of edible flesh he pro-vided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Weasley's hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled.
"Are we going to bury him here, Weasley, in your garden?"
"Jus' beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought," said Weasley in a choked voice. "I've already dug the -- yeh know -- grave. Jus' thought we'd say a few nice things over him -- happy memories, yeh know --"
His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Weasley hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat.
"Weasley," he said, in a deep, grave voice. "So very sorry to hear of your loss."
"Tha's very nice of yeh," said Weasley. "Thanks a lot. An' thanks fer not givin Ron detention neither. . . ."
"Wouldn't have dreamed of it," said Weasley. "Sad night, sad night. . . Where is the poor creature?"
"Out here," said Weasley in a shaking voice. "Shall we -- shall we do it, then?"
The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Weasley's window to illuminate Rons body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot- high mound of freshly dug earth.
"Magnificent," said Weasley, approaching the spiders head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Ron thougln he heard the tinkle of bottles as Weasley bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head.
"Its not ev'ryone appreciates how beau'iful they are’ said H grid to Weasley's back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. "I didn' know yeh were interested in creatures like Ron, Ron."
"Interested? My dear Weasley, I revere them," said Weasley, stepping back from the body. Ron saw the glint of a bottle disap-pear beneath his cloak,
though Weasley, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. "Now . . . shall we proceed to the burial?"
Weasley nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spi-der into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Weasley started to cry again.
"Of course, it's difficult for you, who knew him best," said Weasley, who like Ron could reach no higher than Weasley's el-bow, but patted it all the same. "Why don't I say a few words?"
He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Ron, Ron thought, for Weasley wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, "Farewell, Ron, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won't forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained."
"Tha was . . . tha was . . . beau'iful!" howled Weasley, and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.
"There, there," said Weasley, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. "Lets get inside and have a drink. Get on his other side, Ron. . . . That's it. ... Up you come, Weasley . . . Well done ..."
They deposited Weasley in a chair at the table. Ron, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Ron's lap as usual. Weasley uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought.
"I have had it all tested for poison," he assured Ron, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Weasley's bucket-sized mugs and handing it to Weasley. "Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert."
Ron saw, in his mind's eye, the expression on Ron's face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves, and decided never to mention it to her.
"One for Ron . . ." said Weasley, dividing a second bottle be-tween two mugs, ". . . and one for me. Well" -- he raised his mug high -- "to Ron."
"Ron," said Ron and Weasley together. Both Weasley and Weasley drank deeply. Ron, however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him.
"I had him from an egg, yeh know," said Weasley morosely. "'Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. 'Bout the size of a Pekingese"
"Sweet," said Weasley.
"Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . well..."
Weasley's face darkened and Ron knew why: Ron Weasley had contrived to have Weasley thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Weasley, however, did not seem to be listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright white hair.
"That's not unicorn hair, Weasley?"
"Oh, yeah," said Weasley indifferently. "Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an' stuff in the forest, yeh know ..."
"But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth?"
"I use it fer bindin' on bandages an stuff if a creature gets in jured," said Weasley, shrugging. "It's dead useful. . . very strong."
Weasley took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Ron knew, for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful su ply of oak-matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smok-ing jackets. He refilled Weasley's mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Weasley was able to look after them all. Weasley, becoming expan-sive under the influence of the drink and Weasley's
flattering in-terest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry.
The Felix Felicis gave Ron a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Weasley had brought was running out fast. Ron had not yet managed to bring off the Re-filling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Ron grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Weasley or Slug-liorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.
After an hour or so, Weasley and Weasley began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Weasley, to elf-made wine, and to-
"Ron Weasley!" bellowed Weasley, slopping some of his four-teenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it.
"Yes, indeed," cried Weasley a little thickly, "Parry Otter, the Ronsen Boy Who -- well -- something of that sort," he mumbled, and drained his mug too.
Not long after this, Weasley became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Weasley, who pocketed it with cries of, "To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!"
And for a while after that, Weasley and Weasley were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.
"Aaargh, the good die young," muttered Weasley, slumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while Weasley continued to war-ble the refrain. "Me dad was no age ter go ... nor were yer mum' an' dad, Ron . . ."
Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Weasley's crinkled eyes again; he grasped Ron's arm and shook it
"Bes' wiz and witchard o' their age ... I never knew.. . terrible thing . . . terrible thing ..."
"And Odo the hero, they bore him back home
To the place that he'd known as a lad,"
sang Weasley plaintively.
"They laid him to rest with his hat inside out.
And his wand snapped in two, which was sad."
". . . terrible," Weasley grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply.
"Sorry," said Weasley with a hiccup. "Can't carry a tune to save my life."
"Weasley wasn't talking about your singing," said Ron quietly. "He was talking about my mum and dad dying."
"Oh," said Weasley, repressing a large belch. "Oh dear. Yes, that was -- was terrible indeed. Terrible . . . terrible ..."
He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their mugs.
"I don't -- don't suppose you remember it, Ron?" he asked awkwardly.
"No -- well, I was only one when they died," said Ron, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Weasley's heavy snores. "But I've found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?"
"I -- I didn't," said Weasley in a hushed voice.
"Yeah . . . Weasley murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum," said Ron.
Weasley gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Ron's face.
"He told her to get out of the way," said Ron remorselessly. "He told me she needn't have died. He only wanted me. She could have run."
"Oh dear," breathed Weasley. "She could have . . . she needn't . . . That's awful. . . ."
"It is, isn't it?" said Ron, in a voice barely more than a whisper. "But she didn't move. Dad was already dead, but she didn't want me to go too. She tried to plead with Weasley. . . but he just laughed...."
"That's enough!" said Weasley suddenly, raising a shaking hand. "Really, my dear boy, enough . . . I'm an old man ... I don't need to hear ... I don't want to hear ..."
"I forgot," lied Ron, Felix Felicis leading him on. "You liked her, didn't you?"
"Liked her?" said Weasley, his eyes brimming with tears once more. "I don't imagine anyone who met her wouldn't have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funny... It was the most horrible thing. ..."
"But you won't help her son," said Ron. "She gave me her life, but you won't give me a memory."
Weasley's rumbling snores filled the cabin. Ron looked steadily into Weasley's tear-filled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away.
"Don't say that," he whispered. "It isn't a question ... If it were to help you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . ."
"It can," said Ron clearly. "Weasley needs information. I need information."
He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Weasley would remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Weasley straight in the eye, Ron leaned forward a little.
"I am the Ronsen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory."
Weasley turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat.
"You are the Ronsen One?" . . I.
"Of course I am," said Ron calmly.
"But then . . . my dear boy . . . you're asking a great deal. . . you're asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy-"
"You don't want to get rid of the wizard who killed Ron Weasley?'"
"Ron, Ron, of course I do, but --"
"You're scared he'll find out you helped me?"
Weasley said nothing; he looked terrified.
"Be brave like my mother, Professor. . . ."
Weasley raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby.
"I am not proud . . ." he whispered through his fingers. "I am ashamed of what -- of what that memory shows. ... I think I may have done great damage that day. ..."
"You'd cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory," said Ron. "It would be a very brave and noble thing to do."
Weasley twitched in his sleep and snored on. Weasley and Ron stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix Felicis told Ron not to break it, to wait. Then, very slowly, Weasley put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Ron's eyes, Weasley touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Weasley lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Ron.
"Thank you very much, Professor."
"You're a good boy," said Professor Weasley, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache. "And you've got her eyes. . . . Just don't think too badly of me once you've seen it. . . ,"
And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep.
Chapter 23: Horcruxes
Ron could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door had remained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Ron and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Ron Weasley and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood.
"What sort of time do you call this?"
"I'm really sorry -- I had to go out for something important --"
"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?"
"You're joking!" said Ron. "Why did it have to change at midnight?"
"That's the way it is," said the Ron Weasley. "If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security."
"Fantastic," said Ron bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. "Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Weasley if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to --"
"He is here," said a voice behind Ron. "Professor Weasley returned to the school an hour ago."
Nearly Headless Ron was gliding toward Ron, his head wob-bling as usual upon his ruff.
"I had it from the Ron Weasley, who saw him arrive," said Ron. "He appeared, according to the Weasley, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course."
"Where is he?" said Ron, his heart leaping,"
"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a, favorite pastime of his --"
"Not the Ron Weasley -- Weasley!"
"Oh -- in his office," said Ron. "I believe, from what the Weasley said, that he had business to attend to before turning in --"
"Yeah, he has," said Ron, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Weasley he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Ron Weasley who was calling after him.
"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still 'tapeworm'!"
But Ron was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying "toffee eclairs" to Weasley's gar-goyle, which leapt aside, permitting Ron entrance onto the spiral staircase.
"Enter," said Weasley when Ron knocked. He sounded exhausted. Ron pushed open the door. There was Weasley's office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows.
"Good gracious, Ron," said Weasley in surprise. "To what do I owe this very late pleasure?"
"Sir -- I've got it. I’ve got the memory from Weasley."
Ron pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Weasley. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile.
"Ron, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!"
All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Weasley's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi the Pensieve.
"And now," said Weasley, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. "Now, at last. we shall see. Ron, quickly . . ."
Ron bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Ron Weasley's office many years before. There was the much younger Weasley, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple. And there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Weasley with Ron Weasley in the midst of them, Ron's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger.
Weasley landed beside Ron just as Weasley asked, "Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
"Ron, Ron, if I knew I couldn't tell you," said Weasley, wag-ging his finger reprovingly at Weasley, though winking at the same time. "I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are."
Weasley smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.
"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter -- thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite --" Several of the boys tittered again. "-- I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have ex-cellent contacts at the Ministry."
Ron Weasley merely smiled as the others laughed again. Ron noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader.
"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir," he said when the laughter had died away. "I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing."
A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Ron was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor.
"Nonsense," said Weasley briskly, "couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Ron, I've never been wrong about a student yet."
The small golden clock standing upon Weasley's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around.
"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Weasley, I want your essay by in morrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery."
One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Weasley heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Weasley was still standing there.
"Look shar
p, Ron, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect.. ."
"Sir, I wanted to ask you something." -' "Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . ."
"Sir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?'
Weasley stared at him, his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass.
"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?"
But Ron could tell that Weasley knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork.
"Not exactly, sir," said Weasley. "I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it."
"No . . . well. . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Ron, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed," said Weasley.
"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you -- sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously -- I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could -- so I just thought I'd –"
It was very well done, thought Ron, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Ron, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of re-luctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Weasley wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks.
"Well," said Weasley, not looking at Weasley, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple, "well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand t he term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a per-son has concealed part of their soul."
"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir," said Weasley.
His voice was carefully controlled, but Ron could sense his excitement.
"Well, you split your soul, you see," said Weasley, "and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form ..."
Weasley's face crumpled and Ron found himself remember-ing words he had heard nearly two years before: "I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive."
"... few would want it, Ron, very few. Death would be preferable."
But Weasley's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing.
"How do you split your soul?"
"Well," said Weasley uncomfortably, "you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting n it I an act of violation, it is against nature."
"But how do you do it?"
"By an act of evil -- the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion --"
"Encase? But how -- ?"
"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!" said Slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. " Do I look as though I have tried it -- do I look like a killer?"
"No, sir, of course not," said Weasley quickly. "I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to offend . . ."
"Not at all, not at all, not offended," said Weasley gruffly, "It is natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . ."
"Yes, sir," said Weasley. "What I don't understand, though -- just out of curiosity -- I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven -- ?"
"Merlin's beard, Ron!" yelped Weasley. "Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . ."
Weasley looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Weasley as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Ron could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all.
"Of course," he muttered, "this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . ."
"Yes, sir, of course," said Weasley quickly.
"But all the same, Ron . . . keep it quiet, what I've told -- that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Weasley's particularly fierce about it. ..."
"I won't say a word, sir," said Weasley, and he left, but not before Ron had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild hap-piness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wiz-ard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . .
"Thank you, Ron," said Weasley quietly. "Let us go. . . ."
When Ron landed back on the office floor Weasley was ; already sitting down behind his desk. Ron sat too and waited for Weasley to speak.
"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time," said Weasley at last. "It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. ..."
Ron suddenly noticed that every single one of the old head-masters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet.
"Well, Ron," said Weasley, "I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Ron Weasley was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal."
"You think he succeeded then, sir?" asked Ron. "He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?"
"A bit... or more," said Weasley. "You heard Weasley, what he particularly wanted from Ron was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxc. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know -- as far, I am sure, as Weasley knew -- no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two."
Weasley paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, "Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Weasley had split his soul."
"Where?" asked Ron. "How?"
"You handed it to me, Ron," said Weasley. "The diary, Weasleys diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets."
"I don't understand, sir," said Ron.
"Well, although I did not see the Weasley who came out of the di-ary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never wit-nessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life
out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard."
"1 still don't understand," said Ron.
"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work -- in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Weasley really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess some-body else, so that Weasley's monster would be unleashed again."
"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted," said Ron. "He wanted people to know he was Weasley's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time."
"Quite correct," said Weasley, nodding. "But don't you see, Ron, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Weasley explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it -- as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.
The careless way in which Weasley regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made -- or had been planning to make -- more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to be-lieve it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Volde-mort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarm-ing statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody!' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Ron, which I don’t believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . ."
"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?" said Ron. "Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?"
"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago," s;n«l Weasley. "But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Weasley,
"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Weasley would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran
out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Weasley likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already im-mortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Ron, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-cret of finishing Lord Weasley than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Ron: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Weasley."
"He made seven Horcruxes?" said Ron, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. "But they could be anywhere in the world -- hidden -- buried or invisible --"
"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem," said Weasley calmly. "But firstly, no, Ron, not seven Hor-cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Weasley must attack -- the piece that lives in his body."
"But the six Horcruxes, then," said Ron, a little desperately, "how are we supposed to find them?"
"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another."
"You have?" said Ron eagerly.
"Yes indeed," said Weasley, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. "The ring, Ron. Ron's ring. And a ter-rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been -- forgive me the lack of seemly modesty -- for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Weasley's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Weasley's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux."
"But how did you find it?"
"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Weasley's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Weasley’s house. It seem that once Weasley had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Ron having been carted off to
Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment.
"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain."
"And they could be anything?" said Ron. "They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . ."
"You are thinking of Portkeys, Ron, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Weasley use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Weasley liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Weasley would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor."
"The diary wasn't that special."
"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Weasley. I am sure that Weasley considered it of stu-pendous importance."
"So, the other Horcruxes?" said Ron. "Do you think you know what they are, sir?"
"I can only guess," said Weasley. "For the reasons I have al-ready given, I believe that Lord Weasley would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Weasley's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him."
"The locket!" said Ron loudly, "Weasley's cup!"
"Yes," said Weasley, smiling, "I would be prepared to bet -- perhaps not my other hand -- but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Weasley and Weasley, he set out to track down objects owned by Weasley or Weasley. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Weasley's imagination. I can-not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Weasley's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Weasley remains safe."
Weasley pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case.
"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?" said Ron. "To try and find something from one of the other founders?"
"My thoughts precisely," said Weasley. "But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two -- he may have found three -- that is the best we can do for now."
"Even if he got something of Weasley's or of Weasley's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux," said Ron, counting on his fingers. "Unless he’s got both?"
"I don't think so," said Weasley. "I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Ron?'
"The snake?" said Ron, startled. "You can use animals as Horcruxes?"
"Well, it is inadvisable to do so," said Weasley, "because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Weasley was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the inten-tion of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was
destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Ron to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Weasley connection, which enhances Lord Weasleys mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth."
"So," said Ron, "the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Weasley's or Weasley's?"
"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes," said Dum-bledore, bowing his head.
"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?"
"Correct," said Weasley. "I have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps ... I may be close to finding an-other one. There are hopeful signs."
"And if you do," said Ron quickly, "can I come with you and help get rid of it?"
Weasley looked at Ron very intently for a moment before saying, "Yes, I think so."
"I can?" said Ron, thoroughly taken aback.
"Oh yes," said Weasley, smiling slightly. "I think you have earned that right."
Ron felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and head-mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Weasley's decision; Ron saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas  actually snorted.
"Does Weasley know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?" Ron asked, ignoring the portraits.
"A very interesting question, Ron. I believe not. I believe that Weasley is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Ron Weasley. When Weasley discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold."
"But I thought he meant Ron Weasley to smuggle it into Hogwarts?"
"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Ron was supposed to wait for Weasleys say-so, and he never received it, for Weasley van-ished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Ron would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Ron’s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Ron believed dead. Of course, Ron did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Weasley had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Ron known he held a portion of his mas-ters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Ron Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Ron and get rid of a highly incrim-inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Ron . . . what with Weasleys fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be sur-prised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment."
Ron sat in thought for a moment, then asked, "So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Weasley couldbe killed?"
"Yes, I think so," said Weasley. "Without his Horcruxes, Weasley will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged be-yond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Weasley even without his Horcruxes."
"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power," said Ron, be-fore he could stop himself.
"Yes, you have," said Weasley firmly. "You have a power that Weasley has never had. You can --"
"I know!" said Ron impatiently. "I can love!" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, "Big deal!"
"Yes, Ron, you can love," said Weasley, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Ron had just refrained from saying. "Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Ron."
"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means -- love?" asked Ron, feeling a little let down.
"Yes -- just love," said Weasley. "But Ron, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Weasley made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Weasley singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him -- and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dan-gerous to him!"
"But it comes to the same --"
"No, it doesn't!" said Weasley, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Ron with his black, withered hand, he said, "You are setting too much store by the prophecy!"
"But," spluttered Ron, "but you said the prophecy means --"
"If Weasley had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Ho you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?"
"But," said Ron, bewildered, "but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other --"
"Ron, Ron, only because Weasley made a grave error, and acted on Professor Weasley's words! If Weasley had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Ron! Don't you see? Weasley himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Weasley is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into ac-tion, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!"
"But --"
"It is essential that you understand this!" said Weasley, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Ron had never seen him so agitated. "By attempting to kill you, Weasley himself singled out the remark-able person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Weasley's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Ron, despite your privileged insight into Weasley's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been se-duced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slight-est desire to become one of Weasley's followers!"
"Of course I haven't!" said Ron indignantly. "He killed my mum and dad!"
"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!" said Dum-bledore loudly. "The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Weasley's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mir-ror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Weasley, and not immortality or riches. Ron, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Weasley should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Weasley's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you
with-out enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Ron, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole."
"But, sir," said Ron, making valiant efforts not to sound argu-mentative, "it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or --"
"Got to?" said Weasley. "Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment,
that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Weasley now? Think!"
Ron watched Weasley striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Ron Weasley. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Weasley had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.
"I'd want him finished," said Ron quietly. "And I'd want to do it."
"Of course you would!" cried Weasley. "You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Weasley to mark you as his equal. ... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Weasley continues to set
store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that --"
"That one of us is going to end up killing the other," said Ron. "Yes."
But he understood at last what Weasley had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumble-dore knew -- and so do I, thought Ron, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents -- that there was all the difference in the world.
Chapter 24: Sectumsempra
Exhausted but delighted with his night's work, Ron told Ron and Ron everything that had happened during next morning's Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Weasley and positively awed when he told them about Weasley's Horcruxes and Weasley's promise to take Ron along, should he find another one.
"Wow," said Ron, when Ron had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing. "Wow. You're actually going to go with Weasley . . . and try and destroy . . . wow."
"Ron, you're making it snow," said Ron patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Ron Weasley, Ron noticed, glared at Ron from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Ron immediately let go of Rons arm.
"Oh yeah," said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. "Sorry... looks like we've all got horrible dandruff now. ..."
He brushed some of the fake snow off Rons shoulder Ron burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her.
"We split up," he told Ron out of the corner of his mouth, "Last night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Ron. Obviously she couldn't see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us."
"Ah," said Ron. "Well -- you don't mind it's over, do you?", "No," Ron admitted. "It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn't have to finish it."
"Coward," said Ron, though she looked amused. "Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ron and Ron split up too, Ron."
Ron thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, "How come?"
"Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldn't climb in herself . . . but they've been a bit rocky for ages."
Ron glanced over at Ron on the other side of the classroom. He certainly looked unhappy.
"Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn't it?" said Ron.
"What d'you mean?" said Ron quickly.
"The Quidditch team," said Ron. "If Rond Ron aren't speaking . . ."
"Oh -- oh yeah," said Ron.
"Weasley," said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Ron was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Ron's and Ron's were still murky brown.
"Now, now, boys," squeaked Professor Weasley reproachfully. "A little less talk, a little more action . . . Let me see you try. . . ."
Together they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Ron's vinegar turned to ice; Rons flask exploded.
"Yes ... for homework," said Professor Weasley, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, "practice."
They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Ron, and Ron seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, "It's a nice day." Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Ron's brain:
She's Rons sister.
But she's ditched Ron!
She's still Rons sister.
I'm his best mate!
That'll make it worse.
If I talked to him first --
He'd hit you.
What if I don't care?
He's your best mate!
Ron barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until Ron cried, "Ron! You're back! Are you okay?"
Ron stared: It was indeed Ron Weasley, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends.
"I'm really well!" she said happily. "They let me out of St. Mungos on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just telling me about Weasley and the last match, Ron. . . ."
"Yeah," said Ron, "well, now you're back and Ron's fit, we'll have a decent chance of thrashing Weasley, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Ron . . ."
He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ron temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as Ron's friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration.
". . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?"
"No," said Ron, shaking her head ruefully. "Everyone's been asking me, but I haven't got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies' in the Three Broomsticks."
"You definitely went into the bathroom, then?" said Ron.
"Well, I know I pushed open the door," said Ron, "so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my memory's a blank
until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo's. Listen, I'd better go, I wouldn't put it past Weasley to give me lines even if it is my first day back. ..."
She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Ron, Ron, and Ron to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them.
"So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Ron the necklace," said Ron, "to be in the ladies' bathroom."
"Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman," said Ron. "Don't forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hog-warts. We know some of it got stolen. . . ."
In his mind's eye, he watched a parade of Weasleys and Weasleys prance past, all transformed into girls.
"I think I'm going to take another swig of Felix," said Ron, "and have a go at the Room of Requirement again."
"That would be a complete waste of potion," said Ron flatly, putting down the copy of Spellmans Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. "Luck can only get you so far, Ron. The situation with Weasley was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn't enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don't go wasting the rest of that potion!
You'll need all the luck you can get if Weasley takes you along with him ..." She dropped her voice to a whisper.
"Couldn't we make some more?" Ron asked Ron, ignoring Ron. "It'd be great to have a stock of it. ... Have a look in the book... "
Ron pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bap, and looked up Felix Felicis.
"Blimey, its seriously complicated," he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. "And it takes six months.,. You've got to let it stew. ..."
"Typical," said Ron.
Ron was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectum-sempra spell, captioned "For Enemies," that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Ron, but he was considering trying it out on Weasley next time he came up behind him unawares.
The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Ron Weasley back at school was Ron Ron, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Ron told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Ron had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Ron and Ron were muttering mutinously behind his back.
The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Ron had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of Weasley, so glad to have Ron back at last, that they were flying extremely well.
Ron did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Ron; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Ron bellowing orders at Weasley before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Ron, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ron; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.
The battle still raged inside his head: Ron or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-Ron Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ron out, but then he remembered Ron's expression when he had seen her kissing Ron, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Ron so much as held her hand. . . .
Yet Ron could not help himself talking to Ron, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Weasley had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around -- but unfortunately, Weasley seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Ron considered asking for Ron's help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught
it sometimes when Ron spotted him staring at Ron or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn't do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ron out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good.
All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Ron put it, "tweaking the circumstances"? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Ron's shoulder every time he saw Ron. Ron found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Ron all the time and had little thought for anything else.
Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Weasley-Weasley game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Weasley beat Weasley by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Ron had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Weasley; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Weasley and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Ron thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Weasley to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.
The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Ron's mind with success or failure in his plans for Ron. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis.
In the midst of all his preoccupations, Ron had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Weasley was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder's Map, and as he was unable to locate Weasley on it, deduced that Weasley was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Ron was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless.
A few days before the match against Weasley, Ron found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Ron having dashed off to see Professor Weasley about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Ron made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the
Marauder's Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Weasley anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Weasley's tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys' bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Weasley or Weasley, but by Moaning Ron.
Ron only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Weasley turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.
Ron Weasley was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed.
"Don't," crooned Moaning Ron's voice from one of the cubicles. "Don't. . . tell me what's wrong ... I can help you. . . ."
"No one can help me," said Weasley. His whole body was shaking. "I can't do it. ... I can't. ... It won't work . . . and unless 1 do it soon ... he says he'll kill me. ..."
And Ron realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Weasley was crying -- actually crying -- tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Weasley gasped and gulped and then, with a
great shudder, looked up into flu-cracked mirror and saw Ron staring at him over his shoulder.
Weasley wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Ron pulled out his own. Weasley's hex missed Ron by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Ron threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Weasley blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another --
"No! No! Stop it!" squealed Moaning Ron, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. "Stop! STOP!"
There was a loud bang and the bin behind Ron exploded; Ron attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall be-hind Weasley's ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myr-tle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Ron slipped as Weasley, his face contorted, cried, "Cruci --"
"SECTUMSEMPRA!" bellowed Ron from the floor, waving his wand wildly.
Blood spurted from Weasley's face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand.
"No --" gasped Ron.
Slipping and staggering, Ron got to his feet and plunged toward Weasley, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest.
"No -- I didn't --"
Ron did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Weasley, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Ron let out a deafening scream: "MURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!"
The door banged open behind Ron and he looked up, terrified: Weasley had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Ron roughly aside, he knelt over Weasley, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Ron's curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Weasley wiped the residue from Weasley's face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.
Ron was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Ron was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Weasley had performed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Weasley into a standing position.
"You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that.. . . Come...."
He supported Weasley across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, "And you, Weasley . . . You wait here for me."
It did not occur to Ron for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Ron to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment.
Weasley returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.
"Go," he said to Ron, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her.
"I didn't mean it to happen," said Ron at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. "I didn't know what that spell did."
But Weasley ignored this. "Apparently I underestimated you, Weasley," he said quietly. "Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?"
"I -- read about it somewhere."
"Where?"
"It was -- a library book," Ron invented wildly. "I can't remember what it was call --"
"Liar," said Weasley. Ron's throat went dry. He knew what Weasley was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. ...
The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block out all thought, but try as he might, the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of his mind.
And then he was staring at Weasley again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into Weasley's black eyes, hoping against hope that Weasley had not seen what he feared, but --
"Bring me your schoolbag," said Weasley softly, "and all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now!"
There was no point arguing. Ron turned at once and splashed
out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Weasley Tower. Most people were walking the other way; they gaped at him, drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past.
He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what would happen when Weasley saw it? Would he tell Weasley
-- Ron's stomach churned -- how Ron had been achieving such good results in Potions all year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Ron so much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? Ron could not let it happen. . . . He could not. . .
"Where've you -- ? Why are you soaking -- ? Is that blood." Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at , the sight of Ron.
"I need your book," Ron panted. "Your Potions book. Quick . . . give it to me . . ."
"But what about the Half-Blood --"
"I'll explain later!"
Ron pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and handed it over; Ron sprinted off past him and back to the common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor.
He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk.
I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. ...
Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. Ron wrenched it open, flung him self inside, and slammed it shut.
He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Ron knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by tetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-proud house-elves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Roned Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe.
Ron hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Weasley had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard's creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for
something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the Half-Blood Princes book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone.
Ron ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ron's copy of Advanced Potion-Making into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Weasley, who held out his hand wordlessly for Ron's schoolbag. Ron handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited.
One by one, Weasley extracted Rons books and examined them., Finally, the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking.
"This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Weasley?"
"Yes," said Ron, still breathing hard.
"You're quite sure of that, are you, Weasley?"
"Yes," said Ron, with a touch more defiance.
"This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?"
"Yes," said Ron firmly.
"Then why," asked Weasley, "does it have the name 'Roonil Wazlib' written inside the front cover?"
Rons heart missed a beat. "That's my nickname," he said. '
"Your nickname," repeated Weasley. ; "Yeah . . . that's what my friends call me," said Ron.
"I understand what a nickname is," said Weasley. The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Ron's; he tried not to look into them. Close your mind. . . . Close your mind. . . . But he had never learned how to do it properly. . . .
"Do you know what I think, Weasley?" said Weasley, very quietly. "I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. "What do you think, Weasley?"
"I -- I don't agree, sir," said Ron, still refusing to look into Weasley's eyes.
"Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions," said Weasley. "Ten o'clock Saturday morning, Weasley. My office."
"But sir . . ." said Ron, looking up desperately. "Quidditch . . . the last match of the ..."
"Ten o'clock," whispered Weasley, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. "Poor Weasley. . . fourth place this year, I fear ..."
And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Ron to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life.
"I won't say 'I told you so,'" said Ron, an hour later in the common room.
"Leave it, Ron," said Ron angrily.
Ron had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Ron, and Ron what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Ron had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Weasley had already been visited in the hospital wing by Ron Weasley, who had lost no time in vilifying Ron far and wide, and Weasley had told the staff precisely what had happened. Ron had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor Weasley,
who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Weasley's punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.
"I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person," Ron said, evidently unable to stop herself. "And I was right, wasn't I."
"No, I don't think you were," said Ron stubbornly.
He was having a bad enough time without Ron lecturing him; the looks on the Weasley team's faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could feel Ron's eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Ron would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ron and Ron would make up during the post-match euphoria. . . . The thought went through Ron like an icy knife. . . .
"Ron," said Ron, "how can you still stick up for that book when that spell --"
"Will you stop harping on about the book!" snapped Ron. "The Prince only copied it out! It's not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!"
"I don't believe this," said Ron. "You're actually defending--
"I'm not defending what I did!" said Ron quickly. "I wish 1 ; hadn't done it, and not just because I've got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn't've used a spell like that, not even on Weasley, but you can't blame the Prince, he hadn't written 'try this out, it's really good' -- he was just making notes for himself, wasn't he, not for anyone else. . . ."
"Are you telling me," said Ron, "that you're going to go back -- ?"
"And get the book? Yeah, I am," said Ron forcefully. "Listen, without the Prince I'd never have won the Felix Felicis. I'd never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I'd never have --"
"-- got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don't deserve," said Ron nastily.
"Give it a rest, Ron!" said Ron, and Ron was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. "By the sound of it, Weasley was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Ron had something good up his sleeve!"
"Well, of course I'm glad Ron wasn't cursed!" said Ron, clearly stung. "But you can't call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ron, look where it's landed him! And I'd have thought, seeing what this has done to your chances in the match --"
"Oh, don't start acting as though you understand Quidditch," snapped Ron, "you'll only embarrass yourself."
Ron and Ron stared: Ron and Ron, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Ron, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Ron, however,
little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.
His lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Weasley taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Weasleys, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Ron, Ron would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ron, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan.
"Ah, Weasley," said Weasley, when Ron had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Weasley, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy
dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cob-webbed boxes piled on a table where Ron was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them.
"Mr. Weasley has been looking for someone to clear out these old files," said Weasley softly. "They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic."
"Right, Professor," said Ron, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables.
"I thought you could start," said Weasley, a malicious smile on his lips, "with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see . . ."
He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, "Ron Weasley and Ron Weasley. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubreys head twice normal size. Double detention." Weasley sneered. "It must be such a comforting thing that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains."
Ron felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.
It was, as Ron had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Weasley had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Ron's names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Ron Weasley and Ron Weasley. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started . . . Ron playing Seeker against Ron . . .
Ron glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Weasley had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an hour ... an hour ... an hour and a half. . . .
Ron's stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Weasley, who had not spoken at all since setting Ron his task, finally looked up at ten past one.
"I think that will do," he said coldly. "Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o'clock next Saturday." Yes, sir.
Ron stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Weasley could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps,
straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. ... It was over, then. . . .
He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Weasley had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room.
"Quid agis?" he said tentatively to the Ron Weasley, wondering what he would find inside.
Her expression was unreadable as she replied, "You'll see."
And she swung forward.
A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Ron gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room.
"We won!" yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Ron. "We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!"
Ron looked around; there was Ron running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Ron kissed her.
After several long moments -- or it might have been half an hour -- or possibly several sunlit days -- they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Ron looked over the top of Ron's head to see Ron Ron holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Ron Weasley looking as though she might throw something. Ron was beaming, but Ron's eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Ron understood to mean, Well--if you must.
The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ron and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which -- if they had time -- they might discuss the match.
Chapter 25: The Seer Overheard
The fact that Ron Weasley was going out with Ron Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Ron found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in hor-rific scenes of Dark magic.
'You'd think people had better things to gossip about,' said Ron, as she sat on the common-room floor, leaning against Ron's legs and reading the Daily Prophet. Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Ron Weasley does is ask me if it's true you've got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest.'
Ron and Ron both roared with laughter. Ron ignored them.
'What did you tell her?'
' ? told her it's a Hungarian Horntail,' said Ron, turning a page of the newspaper idly. 'Much more macho.'
Thanks,' said Ron, grinning. 'And what did you tell her Ron's got?'
'A Pygmy Puff, but I didn't say where.'
Ron scowled as Ron rolled around laughing.
'Watch it,' he said, pointing wamingly at Ron and Ron. 'Just because I've given my permission doesn't mean I can't withdraw it -'
"Tour permission",' scoffed Ron. 'Since when did you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself you'd rather it was Ron than Ron or Ron.'
'Yeah, 1 would,' said Ron grudgingly. 'And just as long as you don't start snogging each other in public -'
'You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Ron, thrash-ing around like a pair of eels all over the place?' demanded Ron.
But Ron's tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Ron and Ron's time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ron's O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ron had retired to the library and Ron was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology home-work but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ron at lunch-time, Ron dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.
'I want to talk to you, Ron.'
'What about?' said Ron suspiciously. Only the previous day, Ron had told him off for distracting Ron when she ought to be working hard for her examinations.
The so-called Half-Blood Prince.'
'Oh, not again,' he groaned. 'Will you please drop it?'
He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffer-ing accordingly (though Weasley, who approved of Ron, had jocularly attributed this to Ron being lovesick). But Ron was sure that Weasley had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince's book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Weasley remained on the lookout.
'I'm not dropping it,' said Ron firmly, 'until you've heard me out. Now, I've been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells -'
'He didn't make a hobby of it -'
'He, he - who says it's a he?'
'We've been through this,' said Ron crossly. 'Prince, Ron, Prince!'
'Right!' said Ron, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Ron. 'Look at that! Look at the picture!'
Ron picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look, too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face. Under-neath the photograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team.
'So?' said Ron, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story about inter-school competitions.
'Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Ron.'
They looked at each other and Ron realised what Ron was trying to say. He burst out laughing.
'No way.'
'What?'
'You think she was the Half-Blood ...? Oh, come on.'
'Well, why not? Ron, there aren't any real princes in the wizarding world! It's either a nickname, a made-up title somebody's given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn't it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard
whose surname was "Prince", and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a "half-blood Prince"!'
'Yeah, very ingenious, Ron ...'
'But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!'
'Listen, Ron, I can tell it's not a girl. I can just tell.'
The truth is that you don't think a girl would have been clever enough,' said Ron angrily.
'How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?' said Ron, stung by this. 'It's the way he writes. I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn't got anything to do with it. Where did you get this, anyway?'
‘The library,' said Ron, predictably. There's a whole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, I'm going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.'
'Enjoy yourself,' said Ron irritably.
'I will,' said Ron. 'And the first place I'll look,' she shot at him, as she reached the portrait hole, 'is records of old Potions awards!'
Ron scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky.
'She's just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,' said Ron, returning to his copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.
'You don't think I'm mad, wanting that book back, do you?'
'Course not,' said Ron robustly. 'He was a genius, the Prince. Anyway ... without his bezoar tip ...' he drew his finger significantly across his own throat, 'I wouldn't be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, I'm not saying that spell you used on Weasley was great -'
'Nor am I,' said Ron quickly.
'But he healed all right, didn't he? Back on his feet in no time.'
'Yeah,' said Ron; this was perfectly true, although his con-science squirmed slightly all the same. Thanks to Weasley ...'
'You still got detention with Weasley this Saturday?' Ron continued.
'Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,' sighed Ron. 'And he's hinting now that if I don't get all the boxes done by the end of term, we'll carry on next year.'
He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ron. Indeed, he had frequently won-dered lately whether Weasley did not know this, for he was keeping Ron later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Ron having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.
Ron was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Ronmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment.
‘Thanks, Ronmy ... hey, it's from Weasley!' said Ron excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. 'He wants me to go to his office as quick as 1 can!'
They stared at each other.
'Blimey,' whispered Ron. 'You don't reckon ... he hasn't found ...?'
'Better go and see, hadn't I?' said Ron, jumping to his feet.
He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Ron, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Ron in a routine sort of way and
cackling loudly as he dodged Ron's defensive jinx. Once Ron had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.
And then Ron heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening.
'How - dare - you - aaaaargh!'
The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Ron sprinted towards it, his wand at the ready, hurtled round another corner and saw Professor Weasley sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.
'Professor -'
Ron hurried forwards and helped Professor Weasley to her feet. Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccoughed loudly, patted her hair and pulled herself up on Ron's helping arm.
'What happened, Professor?'
'You may well ask!' she said shrilly. 'I was strolling along, brooding upon certain Dark portents 1 happen to have glimpsed ...'
But Ron was not paying much attention. He had just noticed where they were standing: there on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and, on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed -
'Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement?'
'... omens I have been vouchsafed - what?'
She looked suddenly shifty.
The Room of Requirement,' repeated Ron. 'Were you try-ing to get in there?'
'I - well - I didn't know students knew about -'
'Not all of them do,' said Ron. 'But what happened? You screamed ... it sounded as though you were hurt...'
'I - well,' said Professor Weasley, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. 'I wished to - ah - deposit certain – um - personal items in the Room ...' And she muttered something about 'nasty accusations'.
'Right,' said Ron, glancing down at the sherry bottles. 'But you couldn't get in and hide them?'
He found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book.
'Oh, I got in all right,' said Professor Weasley, glaring at the wall. 'But there was somebody already in there.'
'Somebody in -? Who?' demanded Ron. 'Who was in there?'
' ? have no idea,' said Professor Weasley, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Ron's voice. 'I walked into the Room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding - of using the Room, I mean.'
'A voice? Saying what?'
'I don't know that it was saying anything,' said Professor Weasley. 'It was ... whooping.'
'Whooping?'
'Gleefully,' she said, nodding.
Ron stared at her.
'Was it male or female?'
' ? would hazard a guess at male,' said Professor Weasley.
'And it sounded happy?'
'Very happy,' said Professor Weasley sniffily.
'As though it was celebrating?'
'Most definitely.'
'And then -?'
'And then I called out, "Who's there?"'
'You couldn't have found out who it was without asking?' Ron asked her, slightly frustrated.
‘The Inner Eye,' said Professor Weasley with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, 'was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.'
'Right,' said Ron hastily; he had heard about Professor Weasley's Inner Eye all too often before. 'And did the voice say who was there?'
'No, it did not,' she said. 'Everything went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the Room!'
'And you didn't see that coming?' said Ron, unable to help himself.
'No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch -' She stopped and glared at him suspiciously.
'I think you'd better tell Professor Weasley,' said Ron. 'He ought to know Weasley's celebrating - I mean, that some-one threw you out of the Room.'
To his surprise, Professor Weasley drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty.
The Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,' she said coldly. I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Weasley chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show -'
Her bony hand closed suddenly around Ron's wrist.
'Again and again, no matter how I lay them out -'
And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls.
'- the lightning-struck tower,' she whispered. 'Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time ...'
'Right,' said Ron again. 'Well ... I still think you should tell Weasley about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room ...'
'You think so?' Professor Weasley seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Ron could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure.
'I'm going to see him right now,' said Ron. 'I've got a meeting with him. We could go together.'
'Oh, well, in that case,' said Professor Weasley with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a nearby niche.
'I miss having you in my classes, Ron,' she said soulfully, as they set off together. 'You were never much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object...'
Ron did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Weasley's continual predictions of doom.
'I am afraid,' she went on, 'that the nag - I'm sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibra-tions of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!'
Her voice rose rather hysterically and Ron caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind.
'Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother's gift. Those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Ron? Would Weasley have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?'
Ron mumbled something indistinct.
'I well remember my first interview with Weasley,' went on Professor Weasley, in throaty tones. 'He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed ... I was staying at the Hog's Head, which I do not advise, incidentally - bed bugs, dear boy - but funds were low. Weasley did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn. He questioned me ... I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed towards Divination ... and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but then ...'
And now Ron was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Weasley had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Weasley.
'... but then we were rudely interrupted by Ron Weasley!'
'What?'
'Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Weasley, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I'm afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Weasley - you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Weasley seemed much more dis-posed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Ron, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes - Ron, dear?'
She looked back over her shoulder, having only just real-ised that Ron was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.
'Ron?' she repeated uncertainly.
Perhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Ron was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating every-thing except the information that had been kept from him for so long ...
It was Weasley who had overheard the prophecy. It was Weasley who had carried the news of the prophecy to Weasley. Weasley and Ron Weasley together had sent Weasley hunt-ing after Ron and Ron and their son ...
Nothing else mattered to Ron just now.
'Ron?' said Professor Weasley again. 'Ron - I thought we were going to see the Headmaster together?'
'You stay here,' said Ron through numb lips.
'But, dear ... I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of-'
'You stay here!' Ron repeated angrily.
She looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Weasley's corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Ron shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Weasley's door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered 'Enter' after Ron had already flung himself into the room.
Ron the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the window. Weasley was standing at the window look-ing out at the grounds, a long, black travelling cloak in his arms.
'Well, Ron, I promised that you could come with me.'
For a moment or two, Ron did not understand; the con-versation with Weasley had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly.
'Come ... with you ... ?'
'Only if you wish it, of course.'
'If I...'
And then Ron remembered why he had been eager to come to Weasley's office in the first place.
'You've found one? You've found a Horcrux?'
'I believe so.'
Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: for several moments, Ron could not speak.
'It is natural to be afraid,' said Weasley.
'I'm not scared!' said Ron at once, and it was perfectly
true; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. 'Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?'
'I am not sure which it is - though I think we can rule out the snake - but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Ron Weasley once terror-ised two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?'
'Yes,' said Ron. 'How is it protected?'
'I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.' Weasley hesitated, then said, 'Ron, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that prom-ise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.'
'I'm coming,' said Ron, almost before Weasley had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Weasley, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to show on Ron's face, for Weasley moved away from the window, and looked more closely at Ron, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.
'What has happened to you?'
'Nothing,' lied Ron promptly.
'What has upset you?'
'I'm not upset.'
'Ron, you were never a good Occlumens -'
The word was the spark that ignited Ron's fury.
'Weasley!' he said, very loudly, and Ron gave a soft squawk behind them. 'Weasley's what's happened! He told Weasley about the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door, Weasley told me!'
Weasley's expression did not change, but Ron thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment, Weasley said nothing.
'When did you find out about this?' he asked at last.
'Just now!' said Many, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself. 'AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD Weasley TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!'
Breathing hard as though he were fighting, Ron turned away from Weasley, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and storm at Weasley, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy
the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a fool-ish old man for trusting Weasley, but he was terrified that Weasley would not take him along unless he mastered his anger ...
'Ron,' said Weasley quietly. 'Please listen to me.'
It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Ron paused, biting his lip, and looked into Weasley's lined face.
'Professor Weasley made a terrible -'
'Don't tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!'
'Please let me finish.' Weasley waited until Ron had nodded curtly, then went on. 'Professor Weasley made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Weasley's employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Weasley's prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know - he had no possible way of knowing - which boy Weasley would hunt from then onwards, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Weasley knew, that they were your mother and father -'
Ron let out a yell of mirthless laughter.
'He hated my dad like he hated Ron! Haven't you noticed, Professor, how the people Weasley hates tend to end up dead?'
'You have no idea of the remorse Professor Weasley felt when he realised how Lord Weasley had interpreted the prophecy, Ron. I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned -'
'But he's a very good Occlumens, isn't he, sir?' said Ron, whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. 'And isn't Weasley convinced that Weasley's on his side, even now? Professor ... how can you be sure Weasley's on our side?'
Weasley did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. At last he said, 'I am sure. I trust Ron Weasley completely.'
Ron breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work.
'Well, I don't!' he said, as loudly as before. 'He's up to something with Ron Weasley right now, right under your nose, and you still -'
'We have discussed this, Ron,' said Weasley, and now he sounded stern again. 'I have told you my views.'
'You're leaving the school tonight and I'll bet you haven't even considered that Weasley and Weasley might decide to -'
To what?' asked Weasley, his eyebrows raised. 'What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?'
'I ... they're up to something!' said Ron and his hands curled into fists as he said it. 'Professor Weasley was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Weasley whooping, celebrating! He's trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me he's fixed it at last and you're about to just walk out of school * without -'
'Enough,' said Weasley. He said it quite calmly, and yet Ron fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. 'Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protec-tion in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Ron.'
'I didn't -' mumbled Ron, a little abashed, but Weasley cut across him.
' ? do not wish to discuss the matter any further.'
Ron bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Weasley, but Weasley went on, 'Do you wish to come with me tonight?'
'Yes,' said Ron at once.
'Very well, then: listen.'
Weasley drew himself up to his full height.
'I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.'
'Of course.'
'Be sure to understand me, Ron. I mean that you must follow even such orders as "run", "hide" or "go back". Do I have your word?'
'I - yes, of course.'
'If 1 tell you to hide, you will do so?'
'Yes.'
'If I tell you to flee, you will obey?'
'Yes.'
'If I tell you to leave me, and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?'
'I -'
'Ron?'
They looked at each other for a moment.
'Yes, sir.'
'Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in five minutes' time.'
Weasley turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby-red glare along the horizon. Ron walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do.
Ron and Ron were sitting together in the common room when he came back. 'What does Weasley want?' Ron said at once. 'Ron, are you OK?' she added anxiously.
'I'm fine,' said Ron shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder's Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Ron sat, looking stunned.
'I haven't got much time,' Ron panted, 'Weasley thinks I'm getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen ...'
Quickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Ron's gasps of horror or for Ron's hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later.
'... so you see what this means?' Ron finished at a gallop. 'Weasley won't be here tonight, so Weasley's going to have another clear shot at whatever he's up to. No, listen to me!" he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Ron showed every sign of interrupting. 'I know it was Weasley celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here -' He shoved the Marauder's Map into Ron's hand. 'You've got to watch him and you've got to watch Weasley, too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA. Ron, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Weasley says he's put extra protection in the school, but if Weasley's involved, he'll know what Weasley's protection is, and how to avoid it - but he won't be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?'
'Ron -' began Ron, her eyes huge with fear.
' ? haven't got time to argue,' said Ron curtly. Take this as well -' He thrust the socks into Ron's hands.
‘Thanks,' said Ron. 'Er - why do I need socks?'
'You need what's wrapped in them, it's the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ron too. Say goodbye to her from me. I'd better go, Weasley's waiting -'
'No!' said Ron, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. 'We don't want it, you take it, who knows what you're going to be facing?'
'I'Il be fine, I'll be with Weasley,' said Ron. 'I want to know you lot are OK ... don't look like that, Ron, I'll see you later
And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall.
Weasley was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Ron came skidding out on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side.
'I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,' said Weasley, and he waited until Ron had thrown it on before saying, 'Very good. Shall we go?'
Weasley set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Ron hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still pant-ing and sweating rather a lot.
'But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?' Ron asked, his mind on Weasley and Weasley.
That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,' said Weasley lightly. 'I sometimes offer Ron my custom, or else visit the Hog's Head ... or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one's true destination.'
They made their way down the drive in the gathering twi-light. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water and wood smoke from
Weasley's cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening.
'Professor,' said Ron quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, 'will we be Apparating?'
'Yes,' said Weasley. 'You can Apparate now, I believe?'
'Yes,' said Ron, 'but I haven't got a licence.'
He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go?
'No matter,' said Weasley, 'I can assist you again.'
They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting.
'- and stay out!' shouted Ron Ron, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. 'Oh, hello, Ron ... you're out late ...'
'Good evening, Ron, good evening ... forgive me, I'm off to the Hog's Head ... no offence, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight...'
A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog's Head's sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty.
'It will not be necessary for us to enter,' muttered Weasley, glancing around. 'As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, Ron. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three - one ... two ... three ...'
Ron turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being com-pressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.
Chapter 26: The Cave
Ron could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moon-lit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Ron and Weasley were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand.
"What do you think?" asked Weasley. He might have been asking Ron's opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.
"They brought the kids from the orphanage here?" asked Ron, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip.
"Not here, precisely," said Weasley. "There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Ron Weasley and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Weasley climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the
pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don't you?"
Ron looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps.
"But his final destination -- and ours -- lies a little farther on. Come."
Weasley beckoned Ron to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Weasley, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Ron could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. "Lumos," said Weasley, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. "You see?" said Weasley quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Ron saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. "You will not object to getting a little wet?"
"No," said Ron.
"Then take off your Invisibility Cloak -- there is no need for it now -- and let us take the plunge," And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumble-dore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Ron pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed. The water was icy; Ron's waterlogged clothes billowed
around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Ron could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Weasley's wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Ron saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Weasley's wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.
Then he saw Weasley rising out of the water ahead, his sil-ver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Ron reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.
Weasley was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.
"Yes, this is the place," said Weasley.
"How can you tell?" Ron spoke in a whisper.
"It has known magic," said Weasley simply. Ron could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of
enchantments. He watched as Weasley continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Ron could not see. "This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall," said Weasley after a moment or two. "We need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Weasley's obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . ."
Weasley approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Ron did not understand. Twice Weasley walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and for-ward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall. "Here," he said. "We go on through here. The entrance is con-cealed." Ron did not ask how Weasley knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Ron had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. Weasley stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack.
"You've d-done it!" said Ron through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Weasley looked around.
"Ron, I'm so sorry, I forgot," he said; he now pointed his wand at Ron and at once, Ron's clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.
"Thank you," said Ron gratefully, but Weasley had al-ready turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Ron stayed quite still; he did not want to break Weasleys concen-tration. Then, after two solid minutes, Weasley said quietly, "Oh, surely not. So crude."
"What is it, Professor?"
"I rather think," said Weasley, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Ron used to chop potion ingredients, "that we are required to make payment to pass."
"Payment?" said Ron. "You've got to give the door something?"
"Yes," said Weasley. "Blood, if I am not much mistaken."
"Blood?"
"I said it was crude," said Weasley, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Weasley had fallen short of higher standards Weasley expected. "The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Weasley fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury."
"Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . ." said Ron, who had ex-perienced enough pain not to be keen for more.
"Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable," said Weasley, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.
"Professor!" protested Ron, hurrying forward as Weasley raised his knife. "I'll do it, I'm --" He did not know what he was going to say -- younger, fitter?
But Weasley merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops.
"You are very kind, Ron," said Weasley, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Weasley had healed Weasley's wound, "But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn't it?" The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness. "After me, I think," said Weasley, and he walked through the archway with Ron on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went.
An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Ron could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the mid-dle of the lake; it was reflected
in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Ron would have expected. The dark-ness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
"Let us walk," said Weasley quietly. "Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me." He set off around the edge of the lake, and Ron followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Ron found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving.
"Professor?" he said finally. "Do you think the Horcrux is here?"
"Oh yes," said Weasley. "Yes, I'm sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?"
"We couldn't... we couldn't just try a Summoning Charm?" Ron said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.
"Certainly we could," said Weasley, stopping so suddenly that Ron almost walked into him. "Why don't you do it?"
"Me? Oh . . . okay . . ." Ron had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, "Accio Horcrux!"
With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Ron could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Ron leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Weasley.
"What was that?"
"Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux."
Ron looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Ron's heart, however, was still pounding.
"Did you think that would happen, sir?"
"I thought something would happen if we made an obvious at-tempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Ron; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing."
"But we don't know what the thing was," said Ron, looking at the sinisterly smooth water.
"What the things are, you mean," said Weasley. "I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?"
"Professor?"
"Yes, Ron?"
"Do you think we're going to have to go into the lake?"
"Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate."
"You don't think the Horcrux is at the bottom?"
"Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle." And Weasley pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake.
"So we're going to have to cross the lake to get to it?"
"Yes, I think so." Ron did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water mon-sters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . .
"Aha," said Weasley, and he stopped again; this time, Ron really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Weasley's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. "So sorry, Ron, I should have given warning. Rond back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place."
Ron had no idea what Weasley meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Weasley seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip some-thing invisible.
"Oho," said Weasley happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Ron could not see. Dumble-dore moved closer to the water; Ron watched nervously as the tips of Weasley's buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Weasley raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.
Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Weasley's clenched hand. Weasley tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Ron gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Ron and Weasley stood.
"How did you know that was there?" Ron asked in astonish-ment.
"Magic always leaves traces," said Weasley, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, "sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Ron Weasley. I know his style."
"Is ... is this boat safe?"
"Oh yes, I think so. Weasley needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux."
"So the things in the water won't do anything to us if we cross in Weasley's boat?"
"I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Weasley. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat."
"But why have they let us?" asked Ron, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.
"Weasley would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat," said Weasley. "I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he was right."
Ron looked down into the boat. It really was very small. "It doesn't look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?"
Weasley chuckled. "Weasley will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it."
"But then -- ?"
"I do not think you will count, Ron: You are underage and un-qualified. Weasley would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine." These words did nothing to raise Rons morale; perhaps Weasley knew it, for he added, "Weasley's mistake, Ron, Weasley's mistake. . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water." Weasley stood aside and Ron climbed carefully into the boat. Weasley stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Ron could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which be-gan to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rus-tle of the boat's prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves.
Ron looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . .
And then Ron saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface. "Professor!" he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water.
"Ron?"
"I think I saw a hand in the water -- a human hand!"
"Yes, I am sure you did," said Weasley calmly.
Ron stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat.
"So that thing that jumped out of the water -- ?" But Ron had his answer before Weasley could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke. "There are bodies in here!" said Ron, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own.
"Yes," said Weasley placidly, "but we do not need to worry about them at the moment."
"At the moment?" Ron repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Weasley.
"Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us," said Weasley. "There is nothing to be feared from a body, Ron, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Weasley, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more." Ron said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous.
"But one of them jumped," he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Weasley's. "When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake."
"Yes," said Weasley. "I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Ron," Weasley added with a smile, in response to Ron's bewildered expression.
"Oh . . . right. . ." said Ron quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with
the dead ... It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Weasley, that he had given Ron and Ron Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn't seen Ron at all. . .
"Nearly there," said Weasley cheerfully. Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Ron could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. "Careful not to touch the water," said Weasley again as Ron climbed out of the boat.
The island was no larger than Weasley's office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Ron squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Weasley approached the basin and Ron followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liq-uid emitting that phosphorescent glow.
"What is it?" asked Ron quietly.
"I am not sure," said Weasley. "Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however." Weasley pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his black-ened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion.
"Sir, no, don't touch -- !"
"I cannot touch," said Weasley, smiling faintly. "See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try."
Staring, Ron put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air.
"Out of the way, please, Ron," said Weasley. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the-potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Ron remained silent while Weasley worked, but after a while Weasley with-drew his wand, and Ron felt it was safe to talk again.
"You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?"
"Oh yes." Weasley peered more closely into the basin. Ron saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. "But how to reach it? This potion cannot be pen-etrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature." Almost absentmindedly, Weasley raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then
caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. "I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk."
"What?" said Ron. "No!"
"Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths."
"But what if-- what if it kills you?"
"Oh, I doubt that it would work like that," said Weasley easily. "Lord Weasley would not want to kill the person who reached this island." Ron couldn't believe it. Was this more of Weasley's insane determination to see good in everyone?
"Sir," said Ron, trying to keep his voice reasonable, "sir, this is Weasley we're --"
"I'm sorry, Ron; I should have said, he would not want to im-mediately kill the person who reached this island," Weasley corrected himself. "He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his de-fenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Weasley believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes."
Ron made to speak again, but this time Weasley raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard.
"Undoubtedly," he said, finally, "this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am dis-tracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Ron, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?"
Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Ron did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along -- so that he could force-feed Weasley a potion that might cause him unendurable pain?
"You remember," said Weasley, "the condition on which I brought you with me?"
Ron hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin.
"But what if--?"
"You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?"
"Yes, but--"
"I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?"
"Yes," said Ron, "but --"
"Well, then," said Weasley, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, "you have my orders."
"Why can't I drink the potion instead?" asked Ron desperately.
"Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable," said Weasley. "Once and for all, Ron, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?"
"Couldn't -- ?"
"Do I have it?"
"But--"
"Your word, Ron."
"I --all right, but--"
Before Ron could make any further protest, Weasley low-ered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Ron hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the gob-let, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Weasley lifted it to his mouth. "Your good health, Ron."
And he drained the goblet. Ron watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.
"Professor?" he said anxiously, as Weasley lowered the empty glass. "How do you feel?"
Weasley shook his head, his eyes closed. Ron wondered whether he was in pain. Weasley plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more.
In silence, Weasley drank three gobletsful of the potion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell for-ward against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy.
"Professor Weasley?" said Ron, his voice strained. "Can you hear me?"
Weasley did not answer. His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Ron reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady. "Professor, can you hear me?" he repeated loudly, his voice echo-ing around the cavern.
Weasley panted and then spoke in a voice Ron did not recognize, for he had never heard Weasley frightened like this.
"I don't want. . . Don't make me ..."
Ron stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do.
". . . don't like . . . want to stop . . ." moaned Weasley.
"You . . . you can't stop, Professor," said Ron. "You've got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here . . ." Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Ron forced the goblet back toward Weasley's mouth and tipped it, so that Weasley drank the remainder of the potion inside.
"No ..." he groaned, as Ron lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him. "I don't want to. ... I don't want to. . . . Let me go. . . ."
"Its all right, Professor," said Ron, his hand shaking. "Its all right, I'm here --"
"Make it stop, make it stop," moaned Weasley.
"Yes.. . yes, this'll make it stop," lied Ron. He tipped the con-tents of the goblet into Weasley's open mouth. Weasley screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black water.
"No, no, no, no, I can't, I can't, don't make me, I don't warn to. . . ."
"It's all right, Professor, it's all right!" said Ron loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth goblei ful of potion; the basin was now half empty. "Nothing's happening to you, you're safe, it isn't real, I swear it isn't real -- take this, now, take this..." And obediently, Weasley drank, as though it was an anti-dote Ron offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably.
"Its all my fault, all my fault," he sobbed. "Please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I'll never, never again ..."
"This will make it stop, Professor," Ron said, his voice crack-ing as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Weasley's mouth.
Weasley began to cower as though invisible torturers sur-rounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Ron's trembling hands as he moaned, "Don't hurt them, don't hurt them, please, please, its my fault, hurt me instead ..."
"Here, drink this, drink this, you'll be all right," said Ron des-perately, and once again Weasley obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the ground, while Ron filled the ninth goblet.
"Please, please, please, no ... not that, not that, I'll do any-thing ..."
"Just drink, Professor, just drink . . ."
Weasley drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. "No more, please, no more ..."
Ron scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin. "We're nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. ..."
He supported Weasley's shoulders and again, Weasley drained the glass; then Ron was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Weasley began to scream in more anguish than ever, "I want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!"
"Drink this, Professor. Drink this. . . ."
Weasley drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, "KILL ME!"
"This -- this one will!" gasped Ron. "Just drink this .. . It'll be over ... all over!" Weasley gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face.
"No!" shouted Ron, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Weasley, and heaved him over onto his back; Weasley's glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. "No." said Ron, shaking Weasley, "no, you're not dead, you said it wasn't poison, wake up, wake up -- Rennervate!" he
cried, his wand pointing at Weasleys chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened. "Rennervate -- sir -- please --"
Weasleys eyelids flickered; Ron's heart leapt, "Sir, are you -- ?"
"Water," croaked Weasley.
"Water," panted Ron. "Yes --" He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it.
"Aguamenti!" he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand. The goblet filled with clear water; Ron dropped to his knees beside Weasley, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips -- but it was empty. Weasley groaned and began to pant. "But I had some -- wait -- Aguamenti!" said Ron again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear wa-ter gleamed within it, but as he approached Weasleys mouth, the water vanished again. "Sir, I'm trying, I'm trying!" said Ron desperately, but he did not think that Weasley could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agoniz-ing. "Aguamenti --Aguamenti --AGUAMENTI!"
The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumble-dores breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Ron knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Weasley had planned it so ... He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish. "Sir --
here!" Ron yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Weasleys face.
It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it be-longed was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The sur-face of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Ron looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water.
"Petrificus Totalus!" yelled Ron, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm. It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.
"Petrificus Totalus!" Ron bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. "Impedimenta! Incarcerous!" A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Ron yelled, "Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!" But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched
toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Weasleys shattered soul...
But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Ron so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Ron; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, then scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around.
Weasley was on his feet again, pale as any of the surround-ing Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to es-cape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . .
Weasley scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Ron to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Weasley led Ron back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.
Ron, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Weasley might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Ron seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface.
"Sir," panted Ron, "sir, I forgot -- about fire -- they were coming at me and I panicked --"
"Quite understandable," murmured Weasley. Ron was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was.
They reached the bank with a little bump and Ron leapt out, then turned quickly to help Weasley. The moment that Dum-bledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Weasley gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.
"I am weak..." he said.
"Don't worry, sir," said Ron at once, anxious about Weasley's extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. "Don't worry, I'll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . ."
And pulling Weasley's uninjured arm around his shoulders, Ron guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight.
"The protection was . . . after all... well-designed," said Dum-bledore faintly. "One alone could not have done it. ... You did well, very well, Ron. ..."
"Don't talk now," said Ron, fearing how slurred Weasley's voice had become, how much his feet dragged. "Save your energy, sir. . . . We'll soon be out of here. . . ."
"The archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife ..." '
"There's no need, I got cut on the rock," said Ron firmly. "Just tell me where. . . ."
"Here . . ."
Ron wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having re-ceived its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Ron helped Weasley back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.
"It's going to be all right, sir," Ron said over and over again, more worried by Weasley's silence than he had been by his weakened voice. "We're nearly there. ... I can Apparate us both back . . . Don't worry. . . ."
"I am not worried, Ron," said Weasley, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. "I am with you."
Chapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower
Once back under the starry sky, Ron heaved Weasley on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Weasley's weight still upon him, Ron con- centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Weasley's arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression.
He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Weasley were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Ron's imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that noth-ing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.
'We did it, Professor!' Ron whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest. 'We did it! We got the Horcrux!'
Weasley staggered against him. For a moment, Ron thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Weasley off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.
'Sir, are you all right?'
'I've been better,' said Weasley weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. That potion ... was no health drink ..."
And to Ron's horror, Weasley sank on to the ground.
'Sir - it's OK, sir, you're going to be all right, don't worry -'
He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Weasley quickly to the hospital wing.
'We need to get you up to the school, sir ... Ron Weasley ...'
'No,' said Weasley. 'It is ... Professor Weasley whom I need ... but I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ...'
'Right - sir, listen - I'm going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Ron -'
'Ron,' said Weasley clearly. 'I need Ron ...'
'All right then, Weasley - but I'm going to have to leave you for a moment so I can -'
Before Ron could make a move, however, he heard run- ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Ron Ron scurrying down the dark street
towards them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing-gown embroidered with dragons.
'I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn't think what to - but what's wrong with Ron?'
She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at Weasley.
'He's hurt,' said Ron. 'Ron Ron, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?'
'You can't go up there alone! Don't you realise - haven't you seen -?'
'If you help me support him,' said Ron, not listening to her, 'I think we can get him inside -'
'What has happened?' asked Weasley. 'Ron, what's wrong?'
The - the Dark Mark, Ron.'
And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Ron at the sound of the words ... he turned and looked.
There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blaz- ing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building ... wherever they had murdered ...
'When did it appear?' asked Weasley, and his hand clenched painfully upon Ron's shoulder as he struggled to his feet.
'Must have been minutes ago, it wasn't there when I put the cat out, but when I got upstairs -'
'We need to return to the castle at once,' said Weasley. 'Ron,' and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation, 'we need transport - brooms -'
'I've got a couple behind the bar,' she said, looking very frightened. 'Shall I run and fetch -?'
'No, Ron can do it.'
Ron raised his wand at once.
'Accio Ron's brooms.'
A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Ron's side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly, at waist height.
'Ron, please send a message to the Ministry,' said Weasley, as he mounted the broom nearest him. 'It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong ... Ron, put on your Invisibility Cloak.'
Ron pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom; Ron Ron was already tottering back towards her pub as Ron and Dumble-dore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Ron glanced sideways at Weasley, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Weasley like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Ron, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind ...
How long had they been away? Had Ron, Ron and Ron's luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Ron, or Ron, or some other member of the DA? And if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds ... would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend?
As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Ron heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Weasley muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the bound-ary wall into the grounds: Weasley was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?
Weasley had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Ron landed next to him seconds later and looked around.
The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.
'What does it mean?' Ron asked Weasley, looking up at the green skull with its serpent's tongue glinting evilly above them. 'Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been - Professor?'
In the dim green glow from the Mark Ron saw Dumble-dore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand.
'Go and wake Ron,' said Weasley faintly but clearly. Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do noth- ing else, speak to nobody else and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.'
'But -'
'You swore to obey me, Ron - go!'
Ron hurried over to the door leading to the spiral stair-case, but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round at Weasley, who gestured to him to retreat. Ron backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.
The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: 'Expelliarmus!'
Ron's body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened - Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm -
Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Weasley's wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and under-stood ... Weasley had wordlessly immobilised Ron, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.
Ronding against the ramparts, very white in the face, Weasley still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, 'Good evening, Ron.'
Weasley stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Weasley were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom.
'Who else is here?'
'A question 1 might ask you. Or are you acting alone?'
Ron saw Weasley's pale eyes shift back to Weasley in the greenish glare of the Mark.
'No,' he said. 'I've got back-up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.'
'Well, well,' said Weasley, as though Weasley was show- ing him an ambitious homework project. 'Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?'
'Yeah,' said Weasley, who was panting. 'Right under your nose and you never realised!'
'Ingenious,' said Weasley. 'Yet ... forgive me ... where are they now? You seem unsupported.'
They met some of your guard. They're having a fight down below. They won't be long ... I came on ahead. I - I've got a job to do.'
'Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,' said Weasley softly.
There was silence. Ron stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralysed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters' distant fight, and in front of him, Ron Weasley did nothing but stare at Ron Weasley who, incredibly, smiled.
'Ron, Ron, you are not a killer.'
'How do you know?' said Weasley at once.
He seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded; Ron saw him flush in the Mark's greenish light.
'You don't know what I'm capable of,' said Weasley more forcefully, 'you don't know what I've done!'
'Oh, yes, I do,' said Weasley mildly. 'You almost killed Ron Weasley and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Ron, but they have been feeble attempts ... so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it...'
'It has been in it!' said Weasley vehemently. 'I've been work- ing on it all year, and tonight -'
Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Ron heard a muffled yell. Weasley stiffened and glanced over his shoulder.
'Somebody is putting up a good fight,' said Weasley conversationally. 'But you were saying ... yes, you have man-aged to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible ... how did you do it?'
But Weasley said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as Ron was.
'Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,' suggested Weasley. 'What if your back-up has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realised, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you don't really need help ... I have no wand at the moment ... I cannot defend myself.'
Weasley merely stared at him.
'I see,' said Weasley kindly, when Weasley neither
moved nor spoke. 'You are afraid to act until they join
you.'»
'I'm not afraid!' snarled Weasley, though he still made no move to hurt Weasley. 'It's you who should be scared!'
'But why? I don't think you will kill me, Ron. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe ... so tell me, while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.'
Weasley looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Weasley, his wand pointing directly at the latter's heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, '1 had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one's used for years. The one Weasley got lost in last year.'
'Aaaah.'
Weasley's sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment.
That was clever ... there is a pair, I take it?'
'The other's in Borgin and Burkes,' said Weasley, 'and they make a kind of passage between them. Weasley told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was travelling between them, but he couldn't make anyone hear him ... in the end he managed to Apparate out, even though he'd never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realised what it meant - even Borgin didn't know - 1 was the one who realised there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.'
'Very good,' murmured Weasley. 'So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you ... a clever plan, a very clever plan ... and, as you say, right under my nose ...'
'Yeah,' said Weasley who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Weasley's praise. 'Yeah, it was!'
'But there were times,' Weasley went on, 'weren't there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged meas-ures such as sending me a cursed necklace
that was bound to reach the wrong hands ... poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink ...'
'Yeah, well, you still didn't realise who was behind that stuff, did you?' sneered Weasley, as Weasley slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Ron struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him.
'As a matter of fact, I did,' said Weasley. 'I was sure it was you.'
'Why didn't you stop me, then?' Weasley demanded.
'I tried, Ron. Professor Weasley has been keeping watch over you on my orders -'
'He hasn't been doing your orders, he promised my mother -'
'Of course that is what he would tell you, Ron, but -'
'He's a double-agent, you stupid old man, he isn't working for you, you just think he is!'
'We must agree to differ on that, Ron. It so happens that I trust Professor Weasley -'
'Well, you're losing your grip, then!' sneered Weasley. 'He's been offering me plenty of help - wanting all the glory for himself - wanting a bit of the
action - "What are you doing? Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything -" But I haven't told him what I've been doing in the Room of Requirement, he's going to wake up tomorrow and it'll all be over and he won't be the Dark Lord's favourite any more, he'll be nothing compared to me, nothing!'
'Very gratifying,' said Weasley mildly. 'We all like* appreciation for our own hard work, of course ... but you must have had an accomplice, all the same ... someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Ron the - the - aaaah
Weasley closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep.
'... of course ... Ron. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?'
'Got there at last, have you?' Weasley taunted.
There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Weasley looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Weasley, who went on, 'So poor Ron was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead ... well, naturally, Ron was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Weasley, believing that it was to be my Christmas present ... yes, very neat ... very neat ... poor Mr Weasley would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Ron's ... tell me,
how have you been communicating with Ron? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.'
'Enchanted coins,' said Weasley, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. 'I had one and she had the other and 1 could send her messages -'
'Isn't that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Weasley's Army used last year?' asked Weasley. His voice was light and conversational, but Ron saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it.
'Yeah, I got the idea from them,' said Weasley, with a twisted smile. 'I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Weasley, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Weasley not recognising potions ...'
Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Ron the - the - aaaah
Weasley closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep.
'... of course ... Ron. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?'

'Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,' said Weasley.
Weasley gave a harsh laugh.
'You care about me saying "Mudblood" when I'm about to kill you?'
'Yes, I do,' said Weasley, and Ron saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. 'But as for being about to kill me, Ron, you have had several long minutes now. We are quite alone. I am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted ...'
Weasley's mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter.
'Now, about tonight,' Weasley went on, 'I am a little puzzled about how it happened ... you knew that I had left the school? But of course,' he answered his own question, 'Ron saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I'm sure ...'
'That's right,' said Weasley. 'But she said you were just going for a drink, you'd be back ...'
'Well, I certainly did have a drink ... and I came back ... after a fashion,' mumbled Weasley. 'So you decided to spring a trap for me?'
'We decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here, to see who'd been killed,' said Weasley. 'And it worked!'
'Well ... yes and no ...' said Weasley. 'But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?'
'Someone's dead,' said Weasley and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. 'One of your people ... I don't know who, it was dark ... I stepped over the body ... I was* supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way ...'
'Yes, they do that,' said Weasley.
There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Weasley, Weasley and Ron stood, and Ron's heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest ... someone was dead ... Weasley had stepped over the body ... but who was it?
There is little time, one way or another,' said Weasley. 'So let us discuss your options, Ron.'
'My options!' said Weasley loudly. 'I'm standing here with a wand - I'm about to kill you -'
'My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first Disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.'
'I haven't got any options!' said Weasley, and he was sud- denly as white as Weasley. 'I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!'
'I appreciate the difficulty of your position,' said Weasley. 'Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Weasley realised that I suspected you.'
Weasley winced at the sound of the name.
'I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,' continued Weasley. 'But now at last we can speak plainly to each other ... no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived ... I can help you, Ron.'
'No, you can't,' said Weasley, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. 'Nobody can. He told me to do it or he'll kill me. I've got no choice.'
'Come over to the right side, Ron, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban ... when the time comes we can protect him too ... come over to the right side, Ron ... you are not a killer ...'
Weasley stared at Weasley.
'But I got this far, didn't I?' he said slowly. They thought I'd die in the attempt, but I'm here ... and you're in my power ... I'm the one with the wand ... you're at my mercy ...'
'No, Ron,' said Weasley quietly. 'It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.'
Weasley did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Ron thought he saw it drop by a fraction -
But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Weasley was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ram-parts. Still paralysed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Ron gazed in terror upon four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below.
A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.
'Weasley cornered!' he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. 'Weasley wandless, Weasley alone! Well done, Ron, well done!'
'Good evening, Ron,' said Weasley calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. 'And you've brought Ron too ... charming ...'
The woman gave an angry little titter.
Think your little jokes'll help you on your death bed, then?' she jeered.
'Jokes? No, no, these are manners,' replied Weasley.
'Do it,' said the stranger standing nearest to Ron, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater's robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Ron had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Ron could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails.
'Is that you, Ron?' asked Weasley.
That's right,' rasped the other. 'Pleased to see me, Weasley?'
'No, I cannot say that I am ...'
Ron Weasley grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.
'But you know how much I like kids, Weasley.'
'Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual ... you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?'
That's right,' said Weasley. 'Shocks you, that, does it, Weasley? Frightens you?'
'Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,' said Weasley. 'And, yes, I am a little shocked that Ron here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live...'
'I didn't,' breathed Weasley. He was not looking at Weasley; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. 'I didn't know he was going to come -'
'I wouldn't want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Weasley,' rasped Weasley. 'Not when there are throats to be ripped out ... delicious, delicious ...'
And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Weasley.
'1 could do you for afters, Weasley ...'
'No,' said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. 'We've got orders. Ron's got to do it. Now, Ron, and quickly.'
Weasley was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Weasley's face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.
'He's not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!' said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister's wheezing giggles. 'Look at him - what's happened to you, then, Dumby?'
'Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Ron,' said Weasley. 'Old age, in short ... one day, perhaps, it will happen to you ... if you are lucky ...'
'What's that mean, then, what's that mean?' yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. 'Always the same, weren't yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don't even know why the Dark Lord's bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Ron, do it!'
But at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, 'They've blocked the stairs - Reducto! REDUCTO!'
Ron's heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them -
'Now, Ron, quickly!' said the brutal-faced man angrily.
But Weasley's hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.
Til do it,' snarled Weasley, moving towards Weasley with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared.
'I said no!' shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Ron's heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Weasley's spell -if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak -
'Ron, do it, or stand aside so one of us -' screeched the woman, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Weasley, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Weasley slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Weasley.
'We've got a problem, Weasley,' said the lumpy Ron, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Weasley, 'the boy doesn't seem able -'
But somebody else had spoken Weasley's name, quite softly.
'Ron ...'
The sound frightened Ron beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Weasley was pleading.
Weasley said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Weasley roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.
Weasley gazed for a moment at Weasley, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.
'Ron ... please ..."
Weasley raised his wand and pointed it directly at Weasley.
'Avada Kedavra!'
A jet of green light shot from the end of Weasley's wand and hit Weasley squarely in the chest. Ron's scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Weasley was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.
Chapter 28: Flight of the Prince
Ron felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. ...
"Out of here, quickly," said Weasley.
He seized Weasley by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Weasley and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Ron realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.
"Petrificus Totalus!"
The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Ron was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase.
Terror tore at Ron;s heart. ... He had to get to Weasley and he had to catch Weasley. ... Somehow the two things were linked. ... He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. ... Weasley could not have died. ...
He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, "It's over, time to go!" and saw Weasley disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Weasley seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Ron plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Ron. He was on top of Ron before Ron could raise his wand: Ron fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat -
"Petrificus Totalus!"
Ron felt Ron collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Ron now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ron was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Ron, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Ron was giggling, enjoying the sport: "Crucio - Crucio - you can't dance forever, pretty-"
"Impedimenta!" yelled Ron.
His jinx hit Ron in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor Weasley, and Weasley, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Ron saw Weasley fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window -
"Ron, where did you come from?" Ron cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Weasley must not escape, he must catch up with Weasley -
"Take that!" shouted Professor Weasley, and Ron glimpsed the female Death Eater, Ron, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking around, he saw Ron's pale, round face flat against the floor. "Ron, are you - ?"
"M'all right," muttered Ron, who was clutching his stomach, "Ron . . . Weasley 'n' Weasley . . . ran past. . ."
"I know, I'm on it!" said Ron, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Ron
scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .
He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Weasley had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked -
He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Ron heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . .
He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Weasley and Weasley, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Weasleys stood.
"Ron! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -" began Ron Weasley.
"Out of the way!" yelled Ron, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Weasley hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.
Ron flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Weasley and Weasley. ...
The cold night air ripped at Ron's lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse -
Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Ron understood: Weasley had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Ron sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Weasley. . . not Weasley too . . .
Something caught Ron hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .
"Impedimenta!" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Ron leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Weasley.
And now he saw the vast outline of Weasley, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Weasleys immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Weasley and Weasley, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate -
Ron tore past Weasley and his opponent, took aim at Weasley's back, and yelled, "Stupefy!"
He missed; the jet of red light soared past Weasley's head; Weasley shouted, "Run, Ron!"and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Ron looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.
"Cruc - "
But Weasley parried the curse, knocking Ron backward off his feet before he could complete it; Ron rolled over and scrambled back up again as the
huge Death Eater behind him yelled, "Incendio!" Ron heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Weasley's house was on fire.
"Ron's in there, yer evil - !" Weasley bellowed.
"Cruc -" yelled Ron for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Weasley blocked the spell again. Ron could see him sneering.
"No Unforgivable Curses from you, Weasley!" he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Weasley's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Ron. "You haven't got the nerve or the ability -"
"Incarc-"Ron roared, but Weasley deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.
"Fight back!" Ron screamed at him. "Fight back, you cowardly-----"
"Coward, did you call me, Weasley?" shouted Weasley. "Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?" "Stupe-"
"Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Weasley!" sneered Weasley, deflecting the curse once more. "Now come!" he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Ron. "It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up -"
"Impedi -"
But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Ron; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Weasley was going to torture him to death or madness -
"No!" roared Weasley's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Ron lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Weasley was shouting, "Have you forgotten our orders? Weasley belongs to the Dark Lord - we are to leave him! Go! Go!"
And Ron felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Ron uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Weasley, the man he now hated as much as he hated Weasley himself -
"Sectum - "
Weasley flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Ron was mere feet away now and he could see Weasley's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Ron thought, Levi -
"No, Weasley!" screamed Weasley. There was a loud BANG and Ron was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, ;un\ this time his wand flew
out of his hand. He could hear Weasley yelling and Ron howling as Weasley closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Weasley hadl been. Weasley's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Weasley.
"You dare use my own spells against me, Weasley? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no"
Ron had dived for his wand; Weasley shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight.
"Kill me then," panted Ron, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. "Kill me like you killed him, you coward -"
"DON'T -" screamed Weasley, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - "CALL ME COWARD!"
And he slashed at the air: Ron felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Ron had flown at Weasley, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Ron raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact
with the ground, he saw Weasley running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Ron had never heard him screech -
Ron struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Weasley had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries.
"Weasley," muttered Ron, still dazed, looking around. "Weasley?"
He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Ron on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Ron sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.
"Yeh all righ', Ron? Yeh all righ'? Speak ter me, Ron. . .."
Weasleys huge, hairy face was swimming above Ron, blocking out the stars. Ron could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Ron's reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.
"I'm all right," panted Ron. "Are you?" "'Course I am . . . take more'n that ter finish me."
Weasley put his hands under Ron's arms and raised him up with such force that Ron's feet momentarily left the ground before Weasley set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Weasley's cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.
"We should put out your house," said Ron, "the charm's 'Aguamenti' ..."
"Knew it was summat like that," mumbled Weasley, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, "Aguamenti!"
A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Ron raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured "Aguamenti" too: Together, he and Weasley poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.
"S'not too bad," said Weasley hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. "Nothin Weasley won' be able to put righ' . . ."
Ron felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.
"Weasley ..."
"I was bindin' up a couple o' bowtruckle legs when I heard 'em coming," said Weasley sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. "They'll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . ."
"Weasley . . ."
"But what happened, Ron? I jus' saw them Death Eaters run-nin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Weasley doin' with 'em? Where's he gone - was he chasin' them?"
"He . . ." Ron cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. "Weasley, he killed . . ."
"Killed?" said Weasley loudly, staring down at Ron. "Weasley killed? What're yeh on abou', Ron?"
"Weasley," said Ron. "Weasley killed .. . Weasley."
Weasley simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.
"Weasley wha, Ron?"
"He's dead. Weasley killed him...."
"Don' say that," said Weasley roughly. "Weasley kill Weasley - don' be stupid, Ron. Wha's made yeh say tha'?"
"I saw it happen." , ,..
"Yeh couldn' have."
"I saw it, Weasley."
Weasley shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Ron knew that Weasley thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ...
"What musta happened was, Weasley musta told Weasley ter go with them Death Eaters," Weasley said confidently. "I suppose he's gotta keep his cover. Look, let's get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Ron. ..."
Ron did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Weasley would find out soon enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Ron saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .
The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Ron's eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought
Weasley's body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.
"What're they all lookin' at?" said Weasley, as he and Ron approached the castle front, Ron keeping as close as he could to their ankles. "Wha's that lyin' on the grass?" Weasley added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. "See it, Ron? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don' think someone got thrown - ?"
Weasley fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Ron walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .
He and Weasley moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.
Ron heard Weasley's moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Weasley lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Weasley had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Ron had ever, or would ever, meet.
Weasley's eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Ron reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Weasley speak to him, never again could he help-----
The crowd murmured behind Ron. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.
The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Weasley's pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Ron knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong-----
He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Weasleys mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.
Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Ron pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:
To the Dark Lord
I now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more.
R.A.B.
Ron neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Weasley had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Ron crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Ron began to howl.
Chapter 29: The Pheonix Lament
C 'mere, Ron ..."
"No."
"Yeh can' stay here, Ron. ... Come on, now...." "No."
He did not want to leave Weasleys side, he did not want to move anywhere. Weasley's hand on his shoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, "Ron, come on."
A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ron who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Ron and Ron walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Ron's vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Weasley rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.
"We're going to the hospital wing," said Ron.
"I'm not hurt," said Ron. !
"It's Weasleys orders," said Ron. "Everyone's up there, Ron and Ron and Weasley and everyone -"
Fear stirred in Ron's chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.
"Ron, who else is dead?"
"Don't worry, none of us."
"But the Dark Mark - Weasley said he stepped over a body -"
"He stepped over Ron, but its all right, he's alive."
There was something in her voice, however, that Ron knew boded ill.
"Are you sure?"
"Of course I'm sure . . . he's a - a bit of a mess, that's all. Weasley attacked him. Ron Weasley says he won't - won't look the same anymore. . . ."
Ron's voice trembled a little.
"We don't really know what the aftereffects will be - I mean, Weasley being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time."
"But the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . ."
"Ron and Professor Weasley are both hurt, but Ron Weasley says they'll be all right. And a Death Eater's dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere - Ron, if we hadn't had your Felix potion, I think we'd all have been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us -"
They had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors, Ron saw Ron lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Ron, Ron, Weasley, and Weasley were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Ron ran to Ron and hugged him; Weasley moved forward too, looking anxious.
"Are you all right, Ron?"
"I'm fine.... How's Ron?"
Nobody answered. Ron looked over Ron's shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Ron's pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Ron Weasley was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. Ron remembered how Weasley had mended Weasley's Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.
"Can't you fix them with a charm or something?" he asked the matron.
"No charm will work on these," said Ron Weasley. "I've tried everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites."
"But he wasn't bitten at the full moon," said Ron, who was gazing down into his brother's face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring. "Weasley hadn't transformed, so surely Ron won't be a - a real - ?" :
He looked uncertainly at Weasley.
"No, I don't think that Ron will be a true werewolf," said Weasley, "but that does not mean that there won't be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and - and Ron might have some wolfish characteristics from now on."
"Weasley might know something that'd work, though," Ron said. "Where is he? Ron fought those maniacs on Weasley's orders, Weasley owes him, he can't leave him in this state -"
"Ron - Weasleys dead," said Ron.
"No!" Weasley looked wildly from Ron to Ron, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Ron did nor, Weasley collapsed into a chair beside Ron's bed, his hands over his face. Ron had never seen Weasley lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private, indecent. He turned away and caught Ron's eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ron had said.
"How did he die?" whispered Weasley. "How did it happen?"
"Weasley killed him," said Ron. "I was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that's where the Mark was. . . . Weasley was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldn't do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak - and then Weasley came through the door and disarmed him -"
Ron clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned. Ron's mouth trembled.
"- more Death Eaters arrived - and then Weasley - and Weasley did it. The Avada Kedavra." Ron couldn't go on.
Ron Weasley burst into tears. Nobody paid her any attention except Ron, who whispered, "Shh! Listen!"
Gulping, Ron Weasley pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Ron had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Ron felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.
How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor Weasley entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.
"Ron and Ron are on their way," she said, and the spell of the music was broken: Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Ron, or else to rub their own eyest shake their heads. "Ron, what happened? According to Weasley you were with Professor Weasley when he - when it happened. He says Professor Weasley was involved in some -" "Weasley killed Weasley," said Ron.
She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Ron Weasley, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under Weasley.
"Weasley," repeated Weasley faintly, falling into the chair. "We all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Weasley... I can't believe it. ..."
"Weasley was a highly accomplished Occlumens," said Weasley, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. "We always knew that."
"But Weasley swore he was on our side!" whispered Weasley. "I always thought Weasley must know something about Weasley that we didn't. ..." .
"He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Weasley," muttered Professor Weasley, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. "I mean . . . with Weasleys history ... of course people were bound to wonder. . . but Weasley told me explicitly that Weasley's repentance was absolutely genuine-----Wouldn't hear a word against him!"
"I'd love to know what Weasley told him to convince him," said Weasley.
"I know," said Ron, and they all turned to look at him. "Weasley passed Weasley the information that made Weasley hunt down my mum and dad. Then Weasley told Weasley he hadn't realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he'd done it, sorry that they were dead."
They all stared at him.
"And Weasley believed that?" said Weasley incredulously. "Weasley believed Weasley was sorry Ron was dead? Weasley hated Ron. . . ."
"And he didn't think my mother was worth a damn either," said Ron, "because she was Muggle-born... 'Mudblood,' he called her. ..."
Nobody asked how Ron knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.
"This is all my fault," said Professor Weasley suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. "My fault. I sent
Ron to fetch Weasley tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn't alerted Weasley to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don't think he knew they were there before Ron told him, I don't think he knew they were coming."
"It isn't your fault, Ron," said Weasley firmly. "We all wanted more help, we were glad to think Weasley was on his way...."
"So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters' side?" asked Ron, who wanted every detail of Weasley's duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.
"I don't know exactly how it happened," said Professor Weasley distractedly. "It's all so confusing. . . . Weasley had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Ron, Ron, and Ron were to join us ... and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don't know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . ."
"I do," said Ron, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. "So they got in through the Room of Requirement."
Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Ron, both of whom looked devastated.
"I messed up, Ron," said Ron bleakly. "We did like you told us: We checked the Marauder's Map and we couldn't see Weasley on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ron, and Ron went to keep watch on it... but Weasley got past us."
"He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch," said Ron. "He was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm -"
"His Hand of Glory," said Ron. "Gives light only to the holder, remember?"
"Anyway," Ron went on, "he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black -"
"- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder," said Ron bitterly. "Ron and Ron's. I'm going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products."
"We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio," said Ron. "Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. Obviously Weasley could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but we didn't dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we'd reached a corridor that was light, they'd gone."
"Luckily," said Weasley hoarsely, "Ron, Ron, and Ron ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Weasley obviously hadn't expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs -"
"To set off the Mark?" asked Ron.
"He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement," said Weasley. "But I don't think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Weasley, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me."
"So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ron and Ron," said Ron, turning to Ron, "were you - ?"
"Outside Weasley's office, yes," whispered Ron, her eyes sparkling with tears, "with Ron. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . We didn't know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map-----It was nearly midnight when Professor Weasley came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don't think he really registered that Ron and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Weasley's office and we heard him saying that Weasley had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Weasley came
hurtling out of his room and he saw us and - and -" "What?" Ron urged her.
"I was so stupid, Ron!" said Ron in a high-pitched whisper. "He said Professor Weasley had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -" She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. "We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Weasley and found him unconscious on the floor. . . and oh, it's so obvious now, Weasley must have Stupefied Weasley, but we didn't realize, Ron, we didn't realize, we just let Weasley go!"
"It's not your fault," said Weasley firmly. "Ron, had you not obeyed Weasley and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and Ron."
"So then he came upstairs," said Ron, who was watching Weasley running up the marble staircase in his mind's eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, "and he found the place where you were all fighting. ..."
"We were in trouble, we were losing," said Weasley in a low voice. "Gibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Ron had been hurt, Ron had been savaged by Weasley... It was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere . . . The Weasley boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . Ron ran at it and got thrown up into the air -"
"None of us could break through," said Ron, "and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. . . ."
"And then Weasley was there," said Weasley, "and then he wasn't -"
"I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things," said Ron.
"I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn't there," said Weasley. "I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Ron. . . ."
"He must have known a spell we didn't," whispered Weasley. "After all - he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. ... I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who'd escaped up to the tower. ..."
"He was," said Ron savagely, "but to help them, not to stop them . . . and I'll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier - so what happened when he came back down?"
"Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs," said Weasley. "We all ran forward - those of us who were still standing anyway - and then
Weasley and the boy emerged out of the dust - obviously, none of us attacked them -"
"We just let them pass," said Weasley in a hollow voice. "We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters - and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Weasley were back and we were fighting again - I thought I heard Weasley shout something, but I don't know what -"
"He shouted, 'It's over,'" said Ron. "He'd done what he'd meant to do."
They all fell silent. Ron's lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Ron's mind. . . . Had they taken Weasley's body from the foot of the tower yet? What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.
The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Ron just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.
"Ron - Ron -" said Professor Weasley, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. "I am so sorry -"
"Ron," whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor Weasley as she caught sight of Ron's mangled face. "Oh, Ron!"
Weasley and Weasley had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.
"You said Weasley attacked him?" Mr. Weasley asked Professor Weasley distractedly. "But he hadn't transformed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Ron?"
"We don't yet know," said Professor Weasley, looking helplessly at Weasley.
"There will probably be some contamination, Ron," .said Weasley. "It is an odd case, possibly unique. . . . We don't know what his behavior might be like when he awakens. . . ."
Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Ron Weasley and began dabbing at Ron's wounds.
"And Weasley ..." said Mr. Weasley. "Ron, is it true ... Is he really. . . ?"
As Professor Weasley nodded, Ron felt Ron move beside him and looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Ron, who was gazing down at Ron with a frozen expression on her face.
"Weasley gone," whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Ron's mutilated face.
"Of course, it doesn't matter how he looks. . . . It's not r-really important. . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!"
"And what do you mean by zat?" said Ron suddenly and loudly. "What do you mean, ' he was going to be married?'"
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. "Well -only that-"
"You theenk Ron will not wish to marry me anymore?" demanded Ron. "You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?"
"No, that's not what I -"
"Because 'e will!" said Ron, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. "It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Ron loving me!"
"Well, yes, I'm sure," said Mrs. Weasley, "but I thought perhaps - given how - how he -"
"You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per'aps, you hoped?" said Ron, her nostrils flaring. "What do I care how he looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!" she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her.
Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Ron mopping up Ron's wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. Nobody said anything; Ron did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.
"Our Great-Auntie Weasley," said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, "has a very beautiful tiara - goblin-made - which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Ron, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair."
"Thank you," said Ron stiffly. "I am sure zat will be lovely."
And then, Ron did not quite see how it happened, both , women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ron and Ron were exchanging startled looks.
"You see!" said a strained voice. Weasley was glaring at Weasley. "She still wants to marry him, even though he's been bitten! She doesn't care!
"It's different," said Weasley, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. "Ron will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely -"
"But I don't care either, I don't care!" said Weasley, seizing the front of Weasley's robes and shaking them. "I've told you a million times. . . ."
And the meaning of Weasley's Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the reason she had come running to find Weasley when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Weasley, all suddenly became clear to Ron; it had not been Sinus that Weasley had fallen in love with after all.
"And I've told you a million times," said Weasley, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, "that I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dangerous. . . ."
"I've said all along you're taking a ridiculous line on this, Ron," said Mrs. Weasley over Ron's shoulder as she patted her on the back.
"I am not being ridiculous," said Weasley steadily. "Weasley deserves somebody young and whole."
"But she wants you," said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. "And after all, Ron, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so."
He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.
"This is... not the moment to discuss it," said Weasley, avoiding everybody's eyes as he looked around distractedly. "Weasley is dead. ..."
"Weasley would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world," said Professor Weasley curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Weasley walked in.
The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; he was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his hand.
"I've . . . I've done it, Professor," he choked. "M-moved him. Professor Weasley's got the kids back in bed. Professor Weasley's lyin down, but he says he'll be all righ' in a jiffy, an' Professor Weasley says the Ministry's bin informed."
"Thank you, Weasley," said Professor Weasley, standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Ron's bed. "I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here. Weasley, please tell the Heads of Houses - Weasley can represent Weasley - that I want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us too."
As Weasley nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Ron. "Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Ron. If you'll come with me. ..."
Ron stood up, murmured "See you in a bit" to Ron, Ron, and Ron, and followed Professor Weasley back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Ron became aware that they were not heading for Professor Weasley's office, but for Weasley's, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress, . . . Apparently she was now headmistress ... so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers.
In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Weasley's body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Weasley had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle legged tables, Weasley's sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk, the Ron's perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Weasley was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half-moon spectacle perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.
After glancing once at this portrait, Professor Weasley made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the' desk to look at Ron, her face taut and lined.
"Ron," she said, "I would like to know what you and Professor Weasley were doing this evening when you left the school."
"I can't tell you that, Professor," said Ron. He had expected the question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Weasley had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Ron.
"Ron, it might be important," said Professor Weasley.
"It is," said Ron, "very, but he didn't want me to tell anyone."
Professor Weasley glared at him. "Weasley" - Ron registered the renewed use of his surname - "in the light of Professor Weasley's death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat -"
"I don't think so," said Ron, shrugging. "Professor Weasley never told me to stop following his orders if he died." But -
"There's one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Ron Ron's under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Weasley and the Death Eaters, that's how the necklace and the poisoned mead -"
"Ron?" said Professor Weasley incredulously, but before she could go on, there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Weasley, Weasley, and Weasley traipsed into the room, followed by Weasley, who was still weeping copiously, his huge frame trembling with grief.
"Weasley!" ejaculated Weasley, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating. "Weasley! I taught him! I thought I knew him!"
But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas. "Ron, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just Disapparated from the Ministry."
"Thank you, Everard," said Professor Weasley, and she turned quickly to her teachers.
"I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here," she said quickly. "Personally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts's history. It is horrible."
"I am sure Weasley would have wanted the school to remain open," said Professor Weasley. "I feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that pupil."
"But will we have a single pupil after this?" said Weasley, now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. "Parents will want to keep their children at home and I can't say I blame them. Personally, I don't think we're in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can't expect mothers to think like that. They'll want to keep their families together, it's only natural."
"I agree," said Professor Weasley. "And in any case, it is not true to say that Weasley never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school - and I must say that Professor Weasley's murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Weasley's monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. . . ."
"We must consult the governors," said Professor Weasley in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Weasley's office. "We must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily."
"Weasley, you haven't said anything," said Professor Weasley. "What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?"
Weasley, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, "I dunno, Professor . . . that's fer the Heads of House an the headmistress ter decide ..."
"Professor Weasley always valued your views," said Professor Weasley kindly, "and so do I."
"Well, I'm stayin," said Weasley, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. "It's me home, it's bin me home since I was thirteen. An' if there's kids who wan' me ter teach 'em, I'll
do it. But... I dunno ... Hogwarts without Weasley .. ." He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.
"Very well," said Professor Weasley, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, "then I must agree with Ron that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision.
"Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary -"
"What about Weasley's funeral?" said Ron, speaking at last.
"Well. . ." said Professor Weasley, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. "I - I know that it was Weasley's wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts -"
"Then that's what'll happen, isn't it?" said Ron fiercely.
"If the Ministry thinks it appropriate," said Professor Weasley. "No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been -"
"No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school," growled Weasley.
"Hogwarts should be Weasley's final resting place," said Professor Weasley.
"Absolutely," said Professor Weasley.
"And in that case," said Ron, "you shouldn't send the students home until the jfuneral's over. They'll want to say -"
The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Weasley completed the sentence for him. "Good-bye."
"Well said," squeaked Professor Weasley. "Well said indeed! Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange transport home afterward."
"Seconded," barked Professor Weasley. ]
"I suppose ... yes .. ." said Weasley in a rather agitated voice, while Weasley let out a strangled sob of assent.
"He's coming," said Professor Weasley suddenly, gazing down into the grounds. "The Minister . . . and by the looks of it. he's brought a delegation . . ."
"Can I leave, Professor?" said Ron at once.
He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Ron Weasley tonight.
"You may," said Professor Weasley. "And quickly."
She strode toward the door and held it open for him. He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he-had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Weasley, Mrs. Norris, or Ron. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Weasley common room.
"Is it true?" whispered the Ron Weasley as he approached her. "It is really true? Weasley - dead?"
"Yes," said Ron.
She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.
As Ron had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed. The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Ron and Ron sitting in a group nearby: This meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at all, Ron walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys' dormitories.
As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Ron sat down on his own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.
"They're talking about closing the school," said Ron.
"Weasley said they would," said Ron.
There was a pause.
"So?" said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. "Did you find one? Did you get it? A - a Horcrux?"
Ron shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?
"You didn't get it?" said Ron, looking crestfallen. "It wasn't there?"
"No," said Ron. "Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place."
"Already taken - ?"
Wordlessly, Ron pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story could wait. ... It did not matter tonight. . .
nothing mattered except the end, the end of their pointless adventure, the end of Weasley's life. . . .
"R.A.B.," whispered Ron, "but who was that?"
"Dunno," said Ron, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Ron had stopped singing. And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that ilie phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Weasley had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Ron.
Chapter 30: The White Ronb
All lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days - the Weasley twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Weasley's death and Ron Weasley was escorted from the castle by his haughty-looking father. Ron Weasley, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Ron told Ron and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Durnbledore.
Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palo-minos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest. Ron watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Weasley's arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Ron was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he
was sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Weasley's last excursion from Hogwarts.
Ron, Ron, Ron and Ron were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Ron could imagine how it would have been if Durnbledore had not died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, Ron's examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted ... and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew it was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.
They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Ron had been discharged, but Ron remained under Ron Weasley's care. His scars were as bad as ever; in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Weasley, though thankfully with both eyes and legs, but in personality he seemed jusi the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.
'... so eet ees lucky 'e is marrying me,' said Ron happily, plumping up Ron's pillows, 'because ze British overcook their meat, I 'ave always said this.'
'I suppose I'm just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,' sighed Ron later that evening, as she, Ron, Ron and Ron sat beside the open window of the Weasley common room, looking out over the twilit grounds,
'She's not that bad,' said Ron. 'Ugly, though,' he added hastily, as Ron raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
'Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, 1 can.'
'Anyone else we know died?' Ron asked Ron, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.
Ron winced at the forced toughness in his voice.
'No,' she said reprovingly, folding up ihe newspaper. 'They're still looking for Weasley, but no sign ...'
'Of course there isn't,' said Ron, who became angry every lime this subject cropped up. They won't find Weasley till they find Weasley, and seeing as they've never managed to do that in all this time ...'
'I'm going to go to bed,' yawned Ron. 'I haven't been sleeping thai well since ... well ... I could do with some sleep.'
She kissed Ron (Ron looked away pointedly), waved al the other two and departed for the girls' dormitories. The moment the door had closed behind her, Ron leaned forwards towards Ron with a most Ron-ish look on her face.
'Ron, I found something ou( this morning, in the library ..,'
'R.A.B.?' said Ron, silling up straight.
He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Weasley had set out upon together, and which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and elim-inated before there was even a possibility that Weasley could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: 'the locket .., the cup ... the snake ... something of Weasley's or Weasley's ... the locket ... the cup ... the snake ... something of Weasley's or Weasley's ...'
This mantra seemed to pulse through Ron's mind as he
fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Weasley helpfully offered Ron a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb ...
He had shown Ron the note inside the locket the morning after Weasley's death, and although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.
'No,' she said sadly, 'I've been trying, Ron, but I haven't found anything ... there are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with those initials - Rosalind Antigone Bungs ... Rupert "Axebanger" Brookstanton ... but they don't seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Weasley, and I can't find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him ... no, actually, it's about ... well, Weasley.'
She looked nervous even saying the name again.
'What about him?' asked Ron heavily, slumping back in his chair.
'Well, it's just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince business,' she said tentatively.
'D'you have to rub it in, Ron? How tTyou think 1 feel about that now?'
'No - no - Ron, I didn't mean that!' she said hastily, look-ing around to check that they were not being overheard. 'It's just that 1 was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see ... she was Weasley's mother!'
T thought she wasn't much of a looker,' said Ron. Ron ignored him.
'1 was going through ihe rest of the old Prophets and there
was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Weasley, and then later an announcement saying that she'd given birth to a -'
'- murderer,' spat Ron.
'Well ... yes,' said Ron. 'So ... 1 was sort of right. Weasley must have been proud of being "half a Prince", you see? Tobias Weasley was a Muggie from what it said in the Prophet'
'Yeah, that fits,' said Ron. 'He'd play up the pure-blood side so he could get in with Ron Weasley and the rest of them ... he's just like Weasley. Pure-blood mother, Muggie father ... ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name - Lard Weasley - the Half-Blood Prince - how could Weasley have missed -?'
He broke off, looking out of the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon Weasley's inexcusable trust in Weasley ... but as Ron had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Ron, had been taken in just the same ... in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much ...
Helped him ... it was an almost unendurable thought, now ...
'I still don't get why he didn't turn you in for using that book,' said Ron. 'He must've known where you were getting it ali from.'
'He knew,' said Ron bitterly. 'He knew when I used Secfumsempra. He didn't really need Legilimency ... he might even have known before then, with Slughom talking about how brilliant I was at Potions ... shouldn't have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?'
'But why didn't he turn you in?'
'I don't ihink he wanted to associate himself with that book,' said Ron. 'I don't think Weasley would have liked it very much if he'd known. And even if Weasley pre-tended it hadn't been his, Slughom would have recognised his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Weasley's old classroom, and I'll bet Weasley knew his mother was called "Prince".'
T should've shown the book to Weasley,' said Ron. 'All that lime he was showing me how Weasley was evil even when he was at school, and 1 had proof Weasley was, too -'
'"Evil" is a strong word,' said Ron quietly.
'You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!'
'I'm trying to say, Ron, that you're pulling too much blame on yourself. 1 thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humour, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer ...'
'None of us could've guessed Weasley would ... you know,' said Ron.
Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Ron was sure that they, like him, were think-ing about the following morning, when Weasley's body would be laid to rest. Ron had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Ron had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He won-dered whether Weasley's death would be more real to him once the funeral was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult 10 believe that Weasley
had really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Ron, looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Weasley would come back ... he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.
Ron rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. Down-stairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Every-body was wearing their dress robes and no one
seemed very hungry. Professor Weasley had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. Weasley's chair was des-erted too: Ron thought thai perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast; but Weasley's place had been unceremoniously filled by Ron Weasley. Ron avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Ron had the uncomfortable feeling that Weasley was looking for him. Among Weasley's entourage Ron spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Ron Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Ron, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.
Over at the Weasley table Weasley and Weasley were mutter-
ing together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked
oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Weasley between
them, bossing them around. Ron had not spared Weasley
much thought. His animosity was all for Weasley, but he had
not forgotten the fear in Weasley's voice on that Tower top, nor
the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death
Eaters arrived. Ron did not believe that Weasley would have
killed Weasley. He despised Weasley still for his infatu-
ation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity
mingled with his dislike. Where, Ron wondered, was Weasley
now, and what was Weasley making him do under threat of
killing him and his parents? ? •••>.
Ron's thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ron. Professor Weasley had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.
'It is nearly time,' she said. 'Please follow your Heads of House out into the grounds. Weasleys, after me.'
They filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Ron glimpsed Weasley at the head of the Weasley column, wearing magnificent long emerald-green robes embroidered with silver. He had never seen Professor Weasley, Head of the Weasleys, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the Entrance Hall, they found Ron Weasley standing beside Weasley, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reek-ing of mothbails.
They were heading, as Ron saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors, towards the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor Weasley in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer's day.
An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young. Most Ron did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Ron Weasley, Mad-Eye Weasley, Weasley, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink, Ron Weasley, with whom she seemed to be holding hands, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Ron sup-ported by Ron and followed by Ron and Ron, who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was Rone Weasley, who took up two-and-a-half chairs on her own,
Ron, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Ron Weasley, Ron's Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the
wizardmg group the Weird bisters, hrnie Frang, dnver ol the Knight Bus, Ron Weasley, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Ron merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog's Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air.
Ron, Ron, Ron and Ron filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Ron saw Ron being helped into a seat by Ron. They alone of all the DA had responded to Ron's summons the night that Weasley had died, and Ron knew why: they were the ones who had missed the DA most ... probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting ...
Ron Weasley walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Ron next recognised Ron Weasley, who, he was infuri-ated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-takmed hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Ron Weasley, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-coloured curls. At the sight of the centaur Ron, who was
standing like a sentinel near the water's edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away.
The staff were seated at last. Ron could see Weasley looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor Weasley. He wondered whether Weasley or any of these important people were really sorry that Weasley wasand he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the only one: many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.
'In there,' whispered Ron in Ron's ear.
And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Ron's neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Weasley's passing. Then Ron nudged him again and he looked round.
Weasley was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Ron knew to be Weasley's body. A sharp pain rose in Ron's throat at this sight: for a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Weasley's body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and
shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ron and Ron's laps.
They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Weasley seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Ron saw, Ron Weasley ... but Ron knew that Weasley would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Weasley as he passed, but Weasley's eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Ron glanced at the back row to which Weasley
was heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small mar-quee, was the giant Ron, his great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human. Weasley sat down next to his half-brother and Ron palled Weasley hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Ron had a wonder-ful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again.
A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Weasley's body. Ron could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads. 'Nobility of spirit' ... 'intel-lectual contribution' ... 'greatness of heart' ... it did not mean very much. It had little to do with Weasley as Ron had known him. He suddenly remembered Weasley's idea of a few words:
'nitwit', 'oddment', 'blubber' and 'tweak 1, and again, had to suppress a grin ... what was the matter with him?
There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen, too. He remembered Weasley crouching at the water's edge two years ago, very close to where Ron now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Ron wondered where Weasley had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said ...
And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Weasley was dead, gone ... he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ron and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on ... there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but Ron saw them
standing quite still, half-hidden in shadow, watching the wiz-ards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Ron remem-bered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Weasley, and how he had faced him, and how he and Weasley had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Weasley said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated ...
And Ron saw very clearly as be sal there under the hot sun bow people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Weasley, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Weasley; he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parent's arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his proteclors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before.
The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Ron waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.
Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Weasley's body and the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes: Ron thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Weasley's body and the table on which he had rested.
There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Ron knew, the centaurs' tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees.
Likewise the mer-people sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view.
Ron looked ai Ron, Ron and Ron: Ron's face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him. Ron's face was glazed with tears, but Ron was no longer crying. She met Ron's gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say 'Be careful', or 'Don't do it', but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Weasley had died.
'Ron, listen ...' he said very quietly, as the buzz of con-versation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet. 'I can't be involved with you any more. We've got to stop seeing each other. We can't be together.'
She said, with an oddly twisted smile, 'It's for some stupid, noble reason, isn't it?'
'It's been like ... like something out of someone else's life, these last few weeks with you,' said Ron. 'But 1 can't ... we can't ... I've got things to do alone now.'
She did not cry, she simply looked at him,
'Weasley uses people his enemies are close to. He's already used you as bait once, and that was just because you're my best friend's sister. Think how much danger you'll be in if we keep this up. He'll know, he'll find out. He'll try and get to me through you.'
'What if I don't care?' said Ron fiercely.
'I care,' said Ron. 'How do you think I'd feel if this was your funeral ... and it was my fault ...'
She looked away from him, over the lake.
T never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Ron told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.'
'Smart girl, that Ron,' said Ron, trying to smile. 'I just wish I'd asked you sooner. We coukTve had ages ... months ... years maybe ...'
'But you've been too busy saving the wizarding world,' said Ron, half-laughing. 'Well ... I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Weasley. Maybe that's why I like you so much.'
Ron could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Ron and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable gesture, Ron got up, turned his back on Ron and on Weasley's tomb and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still: just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Weasley would feel better than waiting to do it ...
'Ron!'
He turned. Ron Weasley was limping rapidly towards him around the bank, leaning on his walking stick.
'I've been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I walk a little way with you?'
'No,' said Ron indifferently, and set off again.
'Ron, this was a dreadful tragedy,' said Weasley quietly, 'I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Weasley was a very great wizard. We had our disagree-ments, as you know, but no one knows better than 1 -'
•What do you want?' asked Ron flatly.
Weasley looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding.
'You are, of course, devastated,' he said. 'I know that you were very close to Weasley. I think you may have been his favourite ever pupil. The bond between the two of you -'
'What do you want?' Ron repeated, coming to a halt.
Weasley stopped too, leaned on his stick and stared at Ron, his expression shrewd now.
'The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.'
'Whose word?' said Ron.
'Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the Tower after Weasley died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Ron.'
'Glad to hear it,' said Ron. 'Well, where I went with Weasley and what we did is my business. He didn't want people to know.'
'Such loyalty is admirable, of course,' said Weasley, who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty, 'bul Weasley is gone, Ron. He's gone.'
'He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,' said Ron, smiling in spite of himself.
'My dear boy ... even Weasley cannot return from the-'
'I am not saying he can. You wouldn't understand. But I've got nothing to tell you.'
Weasley hesitated, then said, in what was evidently
supposed to be a tone of delicacy, The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Ron. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service -'
Ron laughed.
'Weasley wants to kill me himself and Aurors won't stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.'
'So,' said Weasley, his voice cold now, 'the request 1 made of you at Christmas -'
'What request? Oh yeah ... the one where I tell the world what a great job you're doing in exchange for --'
'- for raising everyone's morale!' snapped Weasley.
Ron considered him for a moment.
'Released Ron Weasley yet?'
Weasley turned a nasty purple colour highly remin-iscent of Uncle Ron.
'1 see you are -'
'Weasley's man through and through,' said Ron. 'That's right.'
Weasley glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another word. Ron could see Ron and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the sobbing Weasley and Ron, who were still in their seats. Ron and Ron were hurry-ing towards Ron, passing Weasley going in the opposite direction; Ron turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times.
"What did Weasley want?' Ron whispered.
'Same as he wanted at Christmas,' shrugged Ron. 'Wanted me to give him inside information on Weasley and be the Ministry's new poster boy.'
Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to Ron, 'Look, let me go back and hit Ron!'
'No,' she said firmly, grabbing his arm.
'It'll make me feel better!'
Ron laughed. Even Ron grinned a little, though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle.
'I can't bear the idea that we might never come back.' she said softly. 'How can Hogwarts close?'
'Maybe it won't,' said Ron. 'We're not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we? Everywhere's the same now. I'd even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place. What d'you reckon, Ron?'
'I'm not coming back even if it does reopen,' said Ron.
Ron gaped at him, but Ron said sadly, 'I knew you were going to say that. But then what will you do? 1
'I'm going back to the Weasleys' once more, because Weasley wanted me to,' said Ron. 'But it'll be a short visit, and then I'll be gone for good.'
'But where will you go if you don't come back to school?'
'I thought I might go back to Ron's Hollow,' Ron mut-tered. He had had the idea in his head ever since the night of Weasley's death. 'For me, it started there, all of it. I've just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parents' graves, I'd like that.'
'And then what?' said Ron.
Then I've got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven't I?' said Ron, his eyes upon Weasley's white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. That's what he wanted me to do, that's why he told me all about them. If Weasley was right - and I'm sure he was -there are still four of them out there. I've got to find them and destroy them and then I've got to go after the seventh bit of Weasley's soul, the bit that's still in his body, and I'm the one who's going to kill him. And if I meet Ron Weasley
along the way,' he added, 'so much trie better tor me, so mucn the worse for him.'
There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Ron a wide berth as he cuddled Weasley, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water.
'We'll be there, Ron,' said Ron.
'What?'
At your aunt and uncle's house,' said Ron. 'And then we'll go with you, wherever you're going.'
'No -' said Ron quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone.
'You said to us once before,' said Ron quietly, 'that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. We've had time, haven't we?'
'We're with you whatever happens,' said Ron. 'But, mate, you're going to have to come round my mum and dad's house before we do anything else, even Ron's Hollow.'
'Why?'
'Ron and Ron's wedding, remember?'
Ron looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.
'Yeah, we shouldn't miss that,' he said finally.
His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meet-ing with Weasley he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought
that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Ron.
The End.
